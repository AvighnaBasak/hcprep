FRIAR LAWRENCE. You say you do not know the lady’s mind. Uneven is the course; I like it not. PARIS. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death, And therefore have I little talk’d of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage, To stop the inundation of her tears, Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. [_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.— Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. Enter Juliet. PARIS. Happily met, my lady and my wife! JULIET. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. PARIS. That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next. JULIET. What must be shall be. FRIAR LAWRENCE. That’s a certain text. PARIS. Come you to make confession to this father? JULIET. To answer that, I should confess to you. PARIS. Do not deny to him that you love me. JULIET. I will confess to you that I love him. PARIS. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. JULIET. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back than to your face. PARIS. Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears. JULIET. The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite. PARIS. Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report. JULIET. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face. PARIS. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it. JULIET. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Are you at leisure, holy father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass? FRIAR LAWRENCE. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone. PARIS. God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye, Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. [_Exit._] JULIET.

I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County. JULIET. Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently. God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time, Give me some present counsel, or behold ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring. Be not so long to speak. I long to die, If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop’st with death himself to scape from it. And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy. JULIET. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower, Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears; Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house, O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls. Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble, And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow; Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest, The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall, Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part depriv’d of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it. JULIET. Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear! FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. JULIET. Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a modern English summary of the passage, aiming for a balance of key themes, character motivations, and literary significance, while retaining the original’s tone and complexity:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe scene depicts Friar Lawrence, a deeply troubled priest, attempting to mediate a marriage between Juliet Capulet and Paris, a young man bound by familial obligation.  The atmosphere is thick with tension and impending crisis. Friar Lawrence, a man wrestling with his own anxieties and a sense of unease, seeks to prevent a disastrous outcome – Juliet’s impending marriage to Paris, which threatens to plunge her into a life of sorrow and potentially her own demise.\n\nParis, driven by a desire for a wife, is insistent on the marriage, and Friar Lawrence, who is contemplating a retreat from his responsibilities, reluctantly agrees. The central conflict revolves around Juliet's grief and her desire for a life free from tears. Juliet’s profound sadness and her determination to escape her current situation—specifically, her love for Tybalt—fuels the drama.\n\nThe passage portrays Juliet as a conflicted character. She expresses a desire for independence and agency, but is also deeply susceptible to the pressure of her family and the expectations placed upon her.  Friar Lawrence acts as a conduit for these tensions, attempting to prevent a catastrophic outcome.  He’s grappling with a sense of impending doom and a feeling that he’s failing to prevent a tragedy. \n\nThe story unfolds with a sense of urgency, and the narrator is acutely aware of the potential consequences of the marriage.  The actions of Paris, coupled with the increasingly desperate feelings of Juliet, create a compelling narrative of impending disaster.  Friar Lawrence’s desperate attempts to advise Juliet are steeped in a melancholic atmosphere, reflecting his own introspection and apprehension about the future. The passage builds towards a moment of impending crisis and a precarious situation for the young woman involved. \n\nThe imagery throughout is rich and evocative, suggesting a darkening mood. The use of phrases like “the compass of my wits” and “the bloom of her face” conveys a sense of heightened anxiety. The language, reminiscent of Shakespearean style, uses elevated phrasing and dramatic pauses, adding to the overall atmosphere of melancholy and suspense. The references to Romeo and Juliet add a layer of tragic romance, underscoring the central conflict and highlighting the potential for devastating consequences.  Ultimately, the scene culminates in a feeling of urgent, almost desperate, intervention, as Friar Lawrence tries to avert a catastrophic fate.",

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a detailed modern summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text’s essence, while maintaining a strong sense of the Shakespearean atmosphere and thematic elements:\n\n**Summary of “Friar Lawrence’s Cell”**\n\nThe play opens with Friar Lawrence, a highly-regarded physician, summoned to the castle of a wealthy and emotionally volatile nobleman, Paris, to assist with a crucial marital arrangement.

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a comprehensive, detailed summary of the passage, maintaining the requested tone, thematic elements, and complexities, presented in modern English:\n\n**A Descent into Grief and a Calculated Gambit**\n\nThe scene opens with Friar Lawrence, a man burdened by a melancholic atmosphere, receiving a frantic message from Paris, who is desperate to marry Juliet to Count Paris. The atmosphere is thick with impending tragedy and a palpable sense of unease. The central conflict revolves around Juliet’s emotional turmoil, driven by a profound and unsettling love for Paris, and a calculated plan to prevent a devastating loss.\n\n**The Setup & Character Dynamics:**\n\nFriar Lawrence is a thoughtful, somewhat detached character, deeply contemplative and struggling with a personal crisis – a sense of displacement and a preoccupation with his own mortality. He’s a scholar and a healer, imbued with a pragmatic, almost cynical perspective. Paris is a figure of intense desire and ambition, representing a powerful, albeit somewhat volatile, force. The relationship between them is charged with a palpable tension; a mixture of affection and an underlying, unsettling seriousness. Juliet embodies a passionate, almost desperate yearning, consumed by an overwhelming emotional intensity. \n\n**The Rising Action – A Delicate Dance of Manipulation:**\n\nThe passage details a series of escalating events, largely driven by Friar Lawrence's attempts to control the situation. He utilizes a theatrical and somewhat manipulative approach – presenting Juliet with a carefully crafted, almost desperate plea. The immediate catalyst is the Friar’s conversation with Paris, emphasizing the consequences of postponing the wedding – a significant loss of tears and a possible societal reckoning. This sets the stage for the crucial part of the narrative: Juliet's emotional distress, communicated through her weeping.\n\n**The Core of the Plot – A Calculated Marriage & a Dangerous Plan:**\n\nParis, fueled by a desire to diminish the emotional impact of Juliet’s grief, initiates a series of subtle manipulations, deliberately creating a situation that will force Juliet to choose a particular course of action.  Friar Lawrence, observing this, becomes increasingly concerned and, in a moment of strategic deliberation, decides to intervene. He proposes a solution – a carefully orchestrated plan that involves Juliet’s engagement to Paris, coupled with a significant, potentially unsettling maneuver. The plan hinges on the Friar’s explicit instruction to Juliet to confess her love to Paris, with a specific caveat: a murder of Romeo and his friends.\n\n**Symbolism and Imagery:**\n\nThe language is rich with symbolism, particularly concerning the elements of death and sorrow. The references to “roses,” “dying” and “shadows” evoke a sense of melancholy and impending doom. The imagery of Juliet’s face “fading” and “becoming like death” underscores her emotional descent.  The use of \"cold and drowsy humor\" suggests a deliberate attempt to suppress her feelings, to create a sense of detachment and control, mirroring Friar Lawrence's own contemplative state. \n\n**Thematic Resonance:**\n\nThe passage explores several key themes:\n\n*   **Fate vs. Free Will:** The Friar’s deliberate intervention suggests a willingness to manipulate events for a predetermined outcome, raising questions about whether Juliet’s destiny is inherently determined.\n*   **The Power of Words:** The passage highlights the power of language – the Friar's carefully chosen words and his own theatrical pronouncements – to influence and shape events.\n*   **Mortality and Loss:** The central focus on death and the inevitability of tragedy underscores the passage’s central theme - the loss of a vital and perhaps doomed love.\n\n**The Climax and Resolution:**\n\nThe passage culminates with the Friar’s urgent request for a messenger to bring Juliet to Mantua. The plan is risky, involving Juliet’s wedding to Paris, and a significant action to ensure the death of Romeo and his friends.  The Friar's final, almost desperate plea, reveals his complex preoccupation with mortality and the desire to prevent a greater tragedy, foreshadowing the tragic outcome. The image of Juliet \"sleeping\" is starkly symbolic.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe passage effectively delivers a tense and melancholic scene that delves into the complexities of love, desire, and fatalistic destiny.  It utilizes evocative language and imagery to establish a pervasive atmosphere of unease and highlights Friar Lawrence’s thoughtful and somewhat cynical approach to a pivotal situation.",

Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground; So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear’st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. PAGE. [_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [_Retires._] PARIS. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones, Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans. The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. [_The Page whistles._] The boy gives warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way tonight, To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite? What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile. [_Retires._] Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c. ROMEO. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father. Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady’s face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. BALTHASAR. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. ROMEO. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow. BALTHASAR. For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout. His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [_Retires_] ROMEO. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, [_Breaking open the door of the monument._] And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food. PARIS. This is that banish’d haughty Montague That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,— And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. [_Advances._] Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague. Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. Obey, and go with me, for thou must die. ROMEO. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man. Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury. O be gone. By heaven I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm’d against myself. Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say, A madman’s mercy bid thee run away. PARIS. I do defy thy conjuration, And apprehend thee for a felon here. ROMEO. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy! [_They fight._] PAGE. O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. [_Exit._] PARIS. O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [_Dies._] ROMEO. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris! What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book. I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d. [_Laying Paris in the monument._] How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! Which their keepers call A lightning before death. O, how may I Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife, Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death’s pale flag is not advanced there. Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again. Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest; And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide. Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark. Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. [_Dies._] Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a lantern, crow, and spade. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there? Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead? BALTHASAR. Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, It burneth in the Capels’ monument. BALTHASAR. It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master, One that you love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who is it? BALTHASAR. Romeo. FRIAR LAWRENCE. How long hath he been there? BALTHASAR. Full half an hour. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Go with me to the vault. BALTHASAR. I dare not, sir; My master knows not but I am gone hence, And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. BALTHASAR. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Romeo! [_Advances._] Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour’d by this place of peace? [_Enters the monument._] Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance? The lady stirs. [_Juliet wakes and stirs._] JULIET. O comfortable Friar, where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo? [_Noise within._] FRIAR LAWRENCE. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. JULIET. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. [_Exit Friar Lawrence._] What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative. [_Kisses him._] Thy lips are warm! FIRST WATCH. [_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way? JULIET. Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger. [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._] This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die. [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._] Enter Watch with the Page of Paris. PAGE. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. FIRST WATCH. The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach. [_Exeunt some of the Watch._] Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues, some others search. [_Exeunt others of the Watch._] We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar. SECOND WATCH. Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard. FIRST WATCH. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence. THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side. FIRST WATCH. A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too. Enter the Prince and Attendants. PRINCE. What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning’s rest? Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others. CAPULET. What should it be that they so shriek abroad? LADY CAPULET. O the people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run With open outcry toward our monument. PRINCE. What fear is this which startles in our ears? FIRST WATCH. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill’d. PRINCE. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. FIRST WATCH. Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs. CAPULET. O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom. LADY CAPULET. O me! This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre. Enter Montague and others. PRINCE. Come, Montague, for thou art early up, To see thy son and heir more early down. MONTAGUE. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age? PRINCE. Look, and thou shalt see. MONTAGUE. O thou untaught! What manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave? PRINCE. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience. Bring forth the parties of suspicion. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus’d. PRINCE. Then say at once what thou dost know in this. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; and their stol’n marriage day Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow’d grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight Return’d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law. PRINCE. We still have known thee for a holy man. Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this? BALTHASAR. I brought my master news of Juliet’s death, And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not, and left him there. PRINCE. Give me the letter, I will look on it. Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place? PAGE. He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch. PRINCE. This letter doth make good the Friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d. CAPULET. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand. MONTAGUE. But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. CAPULET. As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity. PRINCE. A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",

Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place? PAGE. He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch. PRINCE. This letter doth make good the Friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d. CAPULET. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand. MONTAGUE. But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. CAPULET. As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity. PRINCE. A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",

Paris, a Montague, arrives with a torch, setting a volatile atmosphere.  The conversation quickly escalates as Romeo reveals his desperate feelings for Juliet, a Capulet widow.

A frantic Friar Lawrence arrives with a message of urgency, revealing Romeo's desperate attempt to deliver the message.  The play focuses on the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet's doomed love, illustrating the destructive consequences of their forbidden union and the power of fate. \n\n**Key Themes and Elements:**\n\n*   **Forbidden Love:** The central theme is the agonizing conflict between love and familial duty, particularly within the context of a divided society.

Their love is passionate and intense, suggesting an inevitable outcome, yet their actions also contribute to their demise.\n*   **Violence and Tragedy:** The play employs dramatic irony and foreshadowing to create suspense. The murder of Romeo and Juliet is the focal point, highlighting the consequences of their actions. The events are set in a time of political and familial conflict, adding to the tragedy.\n*   **Appearance vs. Reality:**  The characters' outward appearances are often misleading.

The tone is elevated and dramatic, using heightened language and imagery to reflect the characters' emotional turmoil. The play's dialogue is sharp and full of wit, revealing characters' personalities and motivations.  The shifting perspectives, as recounted by the characters, contribute to the play’s overall sense of tragedy and uncertainty.\n\n**Overall Significance:**\n\n* *Romeo and Juliet* remains one of the most iconic love stories in literature, showcasing a potent exploration of themes of destiny, passion, and the destructive power of conflict.

The narrative focuses on Juliet’s isolation and her desperate attempts to communicate with Romeo, a figure whose arrival is vital to her happiness.\n\nThe passage establishes a palpable tension through several interwoven elements. Firstly, the symbolism of the clock striking nine – a pivotal moment marking Juliet’s anticipated Romeo’s arrival – is emphasized, suggesting urgency and a sense of impending doom. The imagery of “nimble-pinion’d doves” and “ Cupid’s wings” creates a poetic, almost mystical atmosphere, hinting at a divine intervention linked to Romeo’s return.\n\nThe Nurse’s voice is a crucial component, acting as a mediator and a voice of cautious observation. The Nurse’s frequent remarks about Romeo’s “weakness” and the “long delay” highlight his perceived failings, adding to Juliet’s growing sense of despair. The Nurse’s pragmatic, almost cynical, response – “Fie, how my bones ache!” – underscores the gravity of the situation.\n\nPeter’s abrupt departure further underscores the scene’s emotional weight. The Nurse's insistence on Juliet’s “simple choice” – that she’s choosing Romeo – becomes a pointed observation about the potential for a hasty and potentially disastrous union. \n\nJuliet’s increasingly desperate plea to Nurse – “How art thou out of breath?” – reveals her profound anxiety and preoccupation with the prospect of Romeo’s arrival. Her repeated requests for information – “What says he of our marriage?” – underscore her desire for a definitive understanding of her future.  The imagery of “Scarlet straight at any news” is subtly significant, suggesting a heightened emotional state and potential for misinterpretation. \n\nThe passage’s structure begins with a dramatic setup – the impending arrival of Romeo – and continues to focus on Juliet’s internal turmoil and the carefully orchestrated efforts to conceal her predicament.  The use of archaic language – “hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell” – creates a sense of formality and deliberate concealment, while the repetition of phrases like “where is your mother?” adds to the feeling of a carefully constructed illusion.\n\nThe overall tone is one of suspense and melancholy, punctuated by moments of intense emotion and subtle humor.  The imagery of shadows, light, and the setting sun creates a visual representation of the emotional landscape of the scene. The narrative, particularly through the Nurse's narration, conveys a sense of impending drama and a high level of emotional stakes – the fate of Romeo hangs precariously in the balance. The language itself is designed to evoke a feeling of a hidden, and potentially treacherous, situation.",

The narrative focuses on Juliet’s emotional state, her desire for a connection with Romeo, and the anxieties surrounding her impending marriage to Paris. \n\nThe opening lines establish a heightened atmosphere – the striking of nine, a significant time for courtship, and the mention of swift messengers representing the wind and Cupid, signaling a fast-paced arrival.

The Nurse’s speech about “nimble-pinion’d doves” – suggesting a deliberate, controlled action – contrasts sharply with Juliet’s quiet, melancholic observation of the setting. \n\nJuliet’s growing anxiety is evident as she describes her condition – a \"lame\" state, a consequence of \"love’s heralds\" thinking of her. The contrast between her apparent vulnerability and her sharp, determined words highlights her emotional turmoil.

Here’s a summary, aiming for a depth and feeling that’s still rooted in Shakespeare’s style, but presented in a straightforward, modern way:\n\n**The Summary:**\n\nThe scene opens in a lavish, dimly lit hall, the air thick with tension and a strange, suffocating atmosphere. It’s a moment of crucial reckoning between Tybalt and Romeo, the star-crossed lovers who’ve been entangled in a bitter feud. Romeo, visibly agitated, is pleading with Capulet, who is a large, imposing figure, radiating a chillingly controlled authority. \n\nCapulet, concerned for his family’s safety, is attempting to reason with Romeo. He’s playing a game of manipulation – a dangerous dance of attempting to appease a volatile young man. Romeo’s initial desperation is palpable; he’s expressing a deep, unsettling sorrow and a desperate need for a chance at something – perhaps a future with Juliet.  He confesses to being ‘caught’ in this web of tragedy, implying he’s been manipulated by fate.\n\nThe central conflict isn't simply a romantic entanglement; it’s a struggle for control and a horrifying realization of consequence. Capulet is attempting to preserve order, to prevent a situation spiraling into bloodshed – a desperate attempt to maintain a fragile peace. However, Romeo’s insistence that he’s ‘caught’ speaks to a deeper, perhaps unsettling, belief that he’s drawn into a destiny he doesn’t fully understand. \n\nThere’s a significant undercurrent of rivalry and hatred simmering beneath the surface. Capulet, while outwardly composed, isn’t entirely comfortable with Romeo’s intensity.  The echoes of past wrongs – a long history of violence between their families – seem to linger, creating a sense of impending doom.  The imagery is dominated by shadows and a coldness; a stark contrast to the warmth of the hall, reflecting the emotional distance between the two characters. \n\nThe dialogue is carefully constructed, laced with veiled threats and promises. Capulet, in a subtle, almost theatrical gesture, hints at the potential for disaster, suggesting that a single misstep could plunge the entire house into chaos. Romeo, in his declarations, hints at a profound sadness – a knowledge that his love for Juliet might be doomed to heartbreak, a sacrifice of immense consequence.  The entire scene suggests a profound and unsettling sense of impending tragedy, masked by a veneer of polite conversation and controlled composure.  It’s a moment of immense vulnerability, a glimpse into a character wrestling with a destiny far darker than he realizes.\n\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect, such as a specific line or character interaction?",

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a summary of that passage, aiming for a deep engagement with the text while maintaining a modern sensibility and focusing on the core elements:\n\n“The Capulet household breathes a heavy, anxious air. A grand hall, bathed in a sickly yellow light, holds a gathering of the most bitter rivals – the Montagues and the Capulets.  It’s a scene steeped in a long-standing, simmering resentment, a powder keg waiting for a spark.  Our protagonist, Juliet, is clearly agitated, pacing like a caged bird, her face a mask of controlled distress.\n\nThe central conflict isn’t a grand battle, but a slow, agonizing erosion of trust. Romeo, the Montague, is relentlessly pursuing Juliet. He’s not offering a passionate declaration of love, but a calculated, almost obsessive pursuit – a desperate game of cat and mouse. He’s drawn to her like a moth to a flame, but his intentions are far from benevolent.  He’s not *loving* her; he's staking a claim, trying to force a connection that’s already fundamentally fractured.\n\nJuliet’s parents, Lord and Lady Capulet, are acutely aware of the fallout. Their carefully constructed facade of familial harmony is crumbling. The atmosphere is thick with unspoken accusations and veiled threats.  The silence between them speaks volumes – a history of power struggles and betrayals.  \n\nRomeo, driven by a potent mix of youthful impulsiveness and a baffling melancholy, is deliberately provoking Juliet’s emotions. He’s projecting a desperate, almost tragic image – a figure caught between her own will and the weighty expectations of her family. His behavior suggests a profound, if misguided, yearning for something beyond the confines of their established world.\n\nThe imagery is particularly poignant:  the flickering candlelight casts long, distorted shadows, hinting at hidden secrets and veiled intentions.  The scene suggests a delicate balance – a precarious truce threatened by a single, impulsive action.  There's a sense that this pursuit of Romeo will irrevocably damage the already strained relationship between the families. It’s a slow, creeping descent into a dangerous moral abyss.  Ultimately, the passage portrays a tragedy not of violent conflict, but of a love so profound it threatens to consume everything around it.”",

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a modern summary of the passage, aiming for a depth that’s present while remaining accessible, incorporating the key elements you’ve outlined:\n\n“The Capulet house is a tense place, simmering with a palpable, almost suffocating, jealousy. Romeo, freshly arrived in Verona, is immediately drawn into a web of bitterness and suspicion, fueled by the shocking revelation that Juliet is married to Paris. He’s desperate to *see* her, to understand the source of this pain, and that compels him to pursue her.  \n\nThe central conflict revolves around their familial rivalry. Tybalt, Juliet’s cousin, is a villain, bitter and aggressive, and his presence amplifies the animosity. He’s a constant threat, a shadow of ill will that hangs over the scene. Romeo and Juliet, despite their youthful passion, are locked in a silent war of possessiveness.  He’s clinging to a fragile illusion of connection, believing he can *rescue* Juliet from this painful situation.  \n\nTheir relationship is built on stolen glances and coded signals. Romeo’s actions – pleading with Friar Laurence to arrange a meeting – suggest a desperate attempt to bridge the gap between them, but it’s a profoundly awkward, almost desperate gesture. Juliet, meanwhile, is trapped by her own predetermined fate, a victim of her family’s established order.  She’s clearly resisting the pressure to *choose* Paris, a symbol of the societal constraints weighing upon her.\n\nThe imagery is key here: a desolate, dark hall, illuminated by flickering candlelight. It feels like a space of enforced silence and hidden accusations.  The color purple, traditionally associated with royalty and a powerful status, is subtly deployed, suggesting a world steeped in conflict and expectation.  The 'ghosts' of the past—the deaths of Romeo’s parents—are alluded to, hinting at a cycle of violence and a lack of genuine solace.\n\nUltimately, the scene depicts a tragedy of miscommunication and impulsive choices. Romeo's ambition and Juliet's resignation – driven by a deep, understandable pain – leads them down a precipice. It’s a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked passion and the devastating consequences of familial pride, a situation where two young people are destined to be consumed by their own complicated relationship, with a significant sense of impending doom hanging in the air.”\n\n---\n\nDo you think this captures the essence you were aiming for?  Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect – perhaps the symbolism within the imagery?",

        "final_summary": "Okay, here’s a summary of that passage, aiming for a deep engagement with the text while maintaining a modern sensibility and focusing on the core elements:\n\n“The Capulet household breathes a heavy, anxious air. A grand hall, bathed in a sickly yellow light, holds a gathering of the most bitter rivals – the Montagues and the Capulets.  It’s a scene steeped in a long-standing, simmering resentment, a powder keg waiting for a spark.  Our protagonist, Juliet, is clearly agitated, pacing like a caged bird, her face a mask of controlled distress.\n\nThe central conflict isn’t a grand battle, but a slow, agonizing erosion of trust. Romeo, the Montague, is relentlessly pursuing Juliet. He’s not offering a passionate declaration of love, but a calculated, almost obsessive pursuit – a desperate game of cat and mouse. He’s drawn to her like a moth to a flame, but his intentions are far from benevolent.  He’s not *loving* her; he's staking a claim, trying to force a connection that’s already fundamentally fractured.\n\nJuliet’s parents, Lord and Lady Capulet, are acutely aware of the fallout. Their carefully constructed facade of familial harmony is crumbling. The atmosphere is thick with unspoken accusations and veiled threats.  The silence between them speaks volumes – a history of power struggles and betrayals.  \n\nRomeo, driven by a potent mix of youthful impulsiveness and a baffling melancholy, is deliberately provoking Juliet’s emotions. He’s projecting a desperate, almost tragic image – a figure caught between her own will and the weighty expectations of her family. His behavior suggests a profound, if misguided, yearning for something beyond the confines of their established world.\n\nThe imagery is particularly poignant:  the flickering candlelight casts long, distorted shadows, hinting at hidden secrets and veiled intentions.  The scene suggests a delicate balance – a precarious truce threatened by a single, impulsive action.  There's a sense that this pursuit of Romeo will irrevocably damage the already strained relationship between the families. It’s a slow, creeping descent into a dangerous moral abyss.  Ultimately, the passage portrays a tragedy not of violent conflict, but of a love so profound it threatens to consume everything around it.”",

For this time all the rest depart away: You, Capulet, shall go along with me, And Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our farther pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgement-place. Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt, Citizens and Servants._] MONTAGUE. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? BENVOLIO. Here were the servants of your adversary And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. I drew to part them, in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d, Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears, He swung about his head, and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part. LADY MONTAGUE. O where is Romeo, saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. BENVOLIO. Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun Peer’d forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad, Where underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me. MONTAGUE. Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove. BENVOLIO. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? MONTAGUE. I neither know it nor can learn of him. BENVOLIO. Have you importun’d him by any means? MONTAGUE. Both by myself and many other friends; But he, his own affections’ counsellor, Is to himself—I will not say how true— But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter Romeo. BENVOLIO. See, where he comes. So please you step aside; I’ll know his grievance or be much denied. MONTAGUE. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away, [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._] BENVOLIO. Good morrow, cousin. ROMEO. Is the day so young? BENVOLIO. But new struck nine. ROMEO. Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast? BENVOLIO. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours? ROMEO. Not having that which, having, makes them short. BENVOLIO. In love? ROMEO. Out. BENVOLIO. Of love? ROMEO. Out of her favour where I am in love. BENVOLIO. Alas that love so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. ROMEO. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? BENVOLIO. No coz, I rather weep. ROMEO. Good heart, at what? BENVOLIO. At thy good heart’s oppression. ROMEO. Why such is love’s transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears: What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Farewell, my coz. [_Going._] BENVOLIO. Soft! I will go along: And if you leave me so, you do me wrong. ROMEO. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here. This is not Romeo, he’s some other where. BENVOLIO. Tell me in sadness who is that you love? ROMEO. What, shall I groan and tell thee? BENVOLIO. Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who. ROMEO. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will, A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill. In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. BENVOLIO. I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d. ROMEO. A right good markman, and she’s fair I love. BENVOLIO. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. ROMEO. Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit; And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d, From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d. She will not stay the siege of loving terms Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: O she’s rich in beauty, only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store. BENVOLIO. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? ROMEO. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; For beauty starv’d with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead, that live to tell it now. BENVOLIO. Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her. ROMEO. O teach me how I should forget to think. BENVOLIO. By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. ROMEO. ’Tis the way To call hers, exquisite, in question more. These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair; He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair? Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget. BENVOLIO. I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. [_Exeunt._]",

            "summary": "***\n\nThe play opens with Sampson and Gregory, two ambitious young men, encountering Romeo, a charming and somewhat volatile young man who is recently engaged to Capulet. The initial tension is palpable, fueled by Montague’s presence and the looming threat of a bitter feud between the families. The passage focuses on the escalating conflict surrounding Romeo and his relationship with Capulet, highlighting the brothers’ desperate attempts to control the situation through various schemes.\n\nThe core of the story centers around Sampson’s plan to thwart Romeo’s burgeoning romance with Capulet. Sampson, driven by a desire for recognition and a desire to prove his own worth, proposes a scheme to draw Romeo away from Capulet. Gregory, eager to participate, assists Sampson in enacting this plan. The passage intensifies as they attempt to manipulate events, ultimately culminating in a fight that escalates into a brutal confrontation.\n\nThe fight itself is a pivotal scene, demonstrating the brothers' attempts to assert control and dominance over their rival. Sampson, fueled by a sense of urgency and a desire to prove his power, uses his physicality to hinder Romeo, employing violent gestures and a calculated strategy of disruption. Gregory, in contrast, seems more focused on the practical consequences of the conflict, displaying a more pragmatic approach. The scene highlights the brothers' escalating conflict and the growing sense of danger surrounding Romeo. \n\nAs the fight progresses, the narrative shifts to the arrival of Prince Escalus, who delivers a lengthy speech condemning the Montague family's reckless behavior and warning of severe consequences for any further transgressions. This speech underscores the gravity of the situation and the importance of maintaining peace.  Romeo's presence, though fleeting, becomes a catalyst for the drama, adding a layer of romantic tension and a sense of impending doom.\n\nThe passage explores the thematic of a bitter feud between the Montagues and Capulets, and the resulting chaos it creates. Sampson and Gregory’s actions are motivated by a desire to reassert their own authority and control over Verona, illustrating a fundamental conflict rooted in familial rivalry and ambition.  The characters' escalating schemes and violent confrontations reflect the destructive nature of this conflict, highlighting the precarious state of the city.\n\nThroughout the passage, the language is deliberately archaic, incorporating phrases and expressions that evoke a sense of Shakespearean style. For example, the repeated use of “[_Exeunt…_]” creates a dramatic pause and contributes to a heightened sense of drama, signaling a shift in the narrative. The passage also employs vivid imagery, such as \"feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,\" to create a sense of atmosphere and heighten the emotional impact.\n\nThe final scene depicts the characters returning to Verona, leaving behind the chaos and conflict they have instigated. The characters are exhausted and regretful, demonstrating the cost of their ambition and the tragic consequences of their actions.  The theme of a suppressed love, revealed in Romeo’s melancholy, is subtly woven into the narrative, adding a layer of emotional complexity.  The whole passage successfully evokes a feeling of mounting tension and impending doom, wrapped in the dramatic style of Shakespeare.",

Their immediate purpose is to seek out Romeo, a young man they believe is in danger due to a quarrel with Capulet and his friends. The scene establishes a sense of urgency and impending conflict, fueled by the characters’ individual desires and the overall tension of Verona.\n\nThe core conflict revolves around a dispute between Romeo and his friends, who are arguing about a dispute between their masters and the Montagues. Sampson and Gregory, feeling restless and seeking a quick resolution, decide to intervene and, through a series of actions, attempt to resolve the situation. They confront Romeo, intending to either intimidate or encourage him to fight back.\n\nThe narrative focuses on Sampson’s strategic planning – he intends to “take the wall” of any man or maid of Montague's, symbolizing a forceful intervention to disrupt the feud. Gregory, initially hesitant, eventually agrees, driven by a desire to punish the Montagues. The action quickly escalates when Romeo is attacked and wounded.  Sampson and Gregory, fueled by a desire to disrupt the Montague’s, engage in a physical struggle, ultimately resulting in a brutal fight.\n\nThroughout the confrontation, the passage highlights the characters’ motivations – Sampson seeks to punish the Montagues, Gregory is motivated by a desire to impose his will, and Romeo is caught in a passionate, albeit dangerous, situation, seemingly consumed by love.  The dialogue between Sampson and Gregory reveals their contrasting approaches to the conflict – Sampson prioritizing swift action, while Gregory displays a more cautious, strategic mindset. The scene emphasizes the characters’ desires for control and a sense of justice, reflecting a desire to maintain order within Verona’s established social structure.\n\nThe passage establishes a sense of impending tragedy, foreshadowing the consequences of the Montague’s conflict. The mention of the Prince, a figure of authority, adds to the atmosphere of impending doom, suggesting a larger, unresolved issue that will ultimately lead to a downfall. \n\nThe recurring image of the \"bright smoke\" of love and sorrow is subtly employed to emphasize the emotional intensity of the characters involved. The imagery of the \"bud bit with an envious worm\" symbolizes the potential for a relationship to be destroyed. The conflict is presented as a \"madness most discreet\" and \"choking gall,\" suggesting a dangerous and potentially devastating situation. \n\nThe final exchange between Sampson and Gregory reveals their shared ambition to achieve a desired outcome – to disrupt the Montague’s and bring about a change in Verona’s delicate balance. The passage concludes with the appearance of the two protagonists, emphasizing the sense of an impending crisis, preparing the stage for the central action of Romeo's story. The setting itself—Verona—is used to underscore the dramatic tension.",

Their presence is immediately charged with a simmering tension and a subtle power struggle. The scene establishes the central conflict: Sampson and Gregory are vying for the favor of the Montague family, particularly the affections of Juliet, the daughter of Capulet. The argument focuses on Sampson's desire to “take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s,” a blatant act of aggression and a symbolic demonstration of his dominance.\n\nThe dialogue escalates, revealing the men's intertwined plans to disrupt Capulet’s peace and seize control of the household. Sampson’s provocative remarks and strategic planning – using his words to undermine Capulet’s authority – are central to the plot. Gregory, attempting to counter Sampson's intent, engages in a subtle but effective defense, setting up a dramatic confrontation. \n\nThe scene culminates in a fierce and protracted argument between Sampson and Gregory.

Their presence is immediately charged with a simmering tension and a subtle power struggle. The scene establishes the central conflict: Sampson and Gregory are vying for the favor of the Montague family, particularly the affections of Juliet, the daughter of Capulet. The argument focuses on Sampson's desire to “take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s,” a blatant act of aggression and a symbolic demonstration of his dominance.\n\nThe dialogue escalates, revealing the men's intertwined plans to disrupt Capulet’s peace and seize control of the household.

Gregory, attempting to counter Sampson's intent, engages in a subtle but effective defense, setting up a dramatic confrontation. \n\nThe scene culminates in a fierce and protracted argument between Sampson and Gregory.

            "summary": "Here’s a modern English summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text’s content, incorporating the requested elements:\n\nThe play opens with a lavish gathering hosted by Capulet, Paris, and their servant, a complex scene of familial obligation and strategic maneuvering. Capulet, deeply burdened by a prior engagement – a marriage obligation to a family he's bound to – is anxious about the future of his child, whom he believes hasn't yet experienced the richness of Verona. Paris, a respected and honorable man, is presented as a suitable match for the Capulet family, though he’s somewhat preoccupied with the prospect of a union.\n\nThe servant, a frantic presence, diligently collects information about potential suitors – including the shoemaker, tailor, fisherman, painter, and a charming, yet unsettling, young man named Romeo. The servant’s desperation stems from a mounting sense of obligation to avoid scandal and maintain a positive image for the Capulet household.\n\nRomeo, a skilled and somewhat melancholic young man, is approached with a plea – a seemingly unreasonable request: to be presented to Capulet's house and to receive a generous reward as payment for his presence.  Capulet, though reluctant, agrees to the arrangement, recognizing the potential benefits of a good match for his child and the potential for a beneficial alliance.\n\nThe core of the scene revolves around Capulet’s desire to orchestrate a romantic encounter with Rosaline, a beautiful young woman, and Livia, his niece, further emphasizing his goal to secure a desirable bride. The narrative’s tension is heightened by a series of carefully planned events, including the presentation of several prominent figures – a shoemaker, a tailor, and a fisherman – all of whom are invited to the gathering.  The significance of these gatherings is underscored by the symbolic representation of the “dark heaven light” – a theatrical framing device emphasizing the drama of the event.\n\nRomeo’s earnest attempt to impress Capulet, fueled by an overwhelming desire to win Rosaline’s affection, leads to a significant confrontation. The act of reading a letter, initially presented as a mere transaction, reveals a much larger and more compelling narrative – a potential marriage proposal.  The emotional weight of the situation lies in the consequences of the revelation:  Capulet is compelled to take action, a dramatic escalation that sets the stage for the central conflict.\n\nThe encounter with Romeo triggers a crisis of sorts for Capulet. He’s faced with the overwhelming temptation of a large, seemingly easy, and lucrative union – and an equally compelling opportunity to secure his child's happiness by orchestrating a scene of romantic significance. \n\nUltimately, the scene highlights the complex dynamics of familial loyalty, societal expectations, and the relentless pursuit of a desirable outcome.",

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a modern-day summary of the passage, aiming for a balance of key themes, character motivations, and literary significance, while maintaining the original’s tone and complexity.\n\n**A Bitter Feasting and a Rising Conflict: A Synopsis**\n\nThe play opens with a lavish gathering hosted by Capulet, a deeply preoccupied and somewhat melancholic nobleman, anticipating a wedding. Paris, a charming and somewhat restless young man, is invited, ostensibly for a pleasant evening, but carrying a palpable sense of anxiety about his future. The central conflict revolves around Capulet’s desperate desire to secure a marriage alliance for his child, Rosaline, who is proving to be a significant complication.\n\nCapulet is actively seeking a match, and the entire scene suggests a struggle to prevent the birth of a rival – Paris’s family. The scene highlights Capulet’s control and strategic maneuvering, illustrating a man determined to secure his family’s future through careful negotiation and a calculated display of wealth and influence.  He is burdened by the weight of his obligation to his child and the potential for unhappiness if Rosaline doesn't settle into a suitable marriage.\n\nParis, initially drawn in by the opportunity to enjoy a luxurious evening, begins to feel a growing unease.  He is offered a seemingly harmless but subtly manipulative proposition – a contest designed to showcase his beauty and attract attention.  The conversation reveals a subtle undercurrent of longing and a hint of suppressed feelings, suggesting a past he’s trying to bury.  He is presented as a man of considerable charm and intelligence, masking a potential vulnerability.\n\nThe presence of a diverse group of guests – a collection of potential brides, a representative of the local community, and figures of significance – underscores the pressure Capulet faces in securing alliances.  The characters' interactions are fraught with polite conversation and strategic maneuvering, creating a sense of underlying tension. The focus on the setting and the gathering itself emphasizes the importance of the occasion and the social stakes involved.\n\nThe arrival of Romeo is crucial. He is presented as a romantic, passionate, and slightly tormented young man, grappling with a difficult situation.  His pursuit of Rosaline isn't driven by simple love but by a complex mixture of obligation and a desire to impress. He’s clearly captivated by her, suggesting an attraction that goes beyond mere friendship. The scene is also a testament to the drama of a man trying to impress someone.\n\nThe play’s resolution reveals the core conflict – a collision between Capulet’s ambition and Paris’s growing emotional unease.  Romeo’s intervention – a seemingly impulsive act of passion – throws the established social order into crisis and escalates the situation into a moment of intense drama.  The scene depicts the beginnings of a passionate and potentially dangerous entanglement, setting the stage for further conflict and a dramatic confrontation.\n\n**Overall Tone & Literary Significance:** The passage establishes a palpable atmosphere of anxiety, obligation, and suppressed emotion. The language – particularly the archaic references (\"’tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace\") – adds to the play’s sense of timelessness and underlying drama. The use of dialogue and description creates a sense of carefully constructed social maneuvering, a microcosm of the play’s themes of ambition, desire, and consequence.",

The atmosphere is charged with a palpable tension – Capulet is deeply concerned about a looming obligation, a weighty marriage penalty passed down through generations, and the impending marriage of his child to a wealthy, eligible man.

The Servant, a nervous observer, is tasked with managing the guest list and ensuring the feast’s success.\n\nThe core conflict revolves around Capulet’s desperate desire to secure a marriage alliance – a marriage that will solidify his family’s position and ensure the continuation of a carefully crafted lineage. He’s acutely aware of the social pressures and the historical weight of the arrangement, framing it as a necessary step for his child’s future. The “old accustomd feast” signifies a moment of indulgence and a concentrated display of wealth and potential alliances, which Capulet desperately wants to maintain. \n\nParis, despite his reservations, is presented with an opportunity to alleviate his anxieties.

How long is it now To Lammas-tide? LADY CAPULET. A fortnight and odd days. NURSE. Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!— Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me. But as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—, Of all the days of the year, upon that day: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua: Nay, I do bear a brain.

And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before she broke her brow, And then my husband,—God be with his soul!

Marry, that marry is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married? JULIET. It is an honour that I dream not of. NURSE. An honour! Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat. LADY CAPULET. Well, think of marriage now: younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers. By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.

This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide.

            "summary": "***\n\nThe play opens in Capulet’s opulent house, with Lady Capulet and Nurse present. Juliet, a young woman, is summoned to the room, and the Nurse immediately begins to discuss Juliet’s impending marriage to Paris. The scene establishes a tense atmosphere, laden with foreshadowing and the weight of impending familial duty. Lady Capulet expresses her concern about Juliet’s well-being and the potential complications surrounding her marriage. The Nurse, a pragmatic and slightly melancholic figure, focuses on Juliet's age and the historical context of marriage – it's a matter of familial honor, and a seemingly insurmountable challenge to Juliet's future.\n\nThe Nurse’s conversation delves into the complexities of Juliet’s character, contrasting her youthful beauty with the expectations of Verona society. She emphasizes Juliet’s youth and the potential for a quick marriage, highlighting the pressure on her to fulfill a predetermined role. The Nurse’s anxieties, particularly regarding the “curse” of the library – a reference to the famous “curse of the apple” – suggest a superstitious element and an awareness of the potential negative consequences of marrying Paris.\n\nJuliet, in turn, expresses a sense of reluctance and a desire to avoid engagement, highlighting her desire for solitude and independence. The Nurse, however, pushes forward, emphasizing the historical significance of marriage – the “golden story” of Paris – and Juliet’s potential to be celebrated within Verona’s society. The Nurse skillfully crafts a persuasive argument regarding the value of marriage, using the imagery of a book – a metaphor for a carefully crafted narrative of love – and the “beauty’s pen” suggesting a meticulous and idealized examination of the potential match. She draws parallels between Juliet’s future and the historical story of Paris’ love, creating a deliberate juxtaposition of her present reality with a storied past.\n\nThe Nurse’s detailed observations of Paris – reading the volume of young Paris’ face – reveal a sophisticated and perhaps slightly obsessive interest in understanding the man. The Nurse’s words are laced with a subtle, almost theatrical, sense of observation and a hint of melancholy, framing the situation as a performance – a carefully orchestrated narrative. The Nurse’s final plea for Juliet to “seek happy nights to happy days” subtly underscores the emotional weight of her situation and her desire to avoid a life burdened by the potential of a marriage. The Servant’s arrival further underscores the sense of urgency and the impending storm of family drama.\n\nThe play is steeped in imagery – the \"wormwood\" symbolizes a threat or potential for bitterness – and it employs wordplay (\"By my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’\"), and subtly evokes a sense of impending doom through the mention of an earthquake and the looming presence of a long-ago “brain.”  The overall tone shifts from a cautionary narrative about marriage to a portrait of a young woman grappling with her destiny, driven by the forces of family expectations and the weight of a predetermined future. The language, while seemingly simple, carries an undeniable weight, reflecting the complex emotional landscape of the play.",

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a modern English summary of the passage, aiming for a comprehensive yet accessible reading experience, incorporating the key themes, character motivations, and narrative elements as requested:\n\nThe scene opens with Lady Capulet and Nurse in the Capulet’s opulent house, setting the stage for a fraught conversation regarding Juliet’s impending marriage. The atmosphere is thick with tension and a sense of impending secrecy.  The central conflict revolves around Juliet’s future and the emotional weight of her impending marriage to Paris, a man viewed as a wealthy and desirable option for the Capulet family.\n\nThe passage chronicles a period of intense scrutiny and emotional distress surrounding Juliet's arrival. Nurse, acting as a confidante and mediator, attempts to shield Juliet from the full implications of her pregnancy, emphasizing her youth and the societal pressures surrounding marriage. Lady Capulet, burdened by her anxieties, repeatedly emphasizes the importance of maintaining a “secret” and subtly pressures Juliet to remain secluded.  The Nurse’s role is pivotal – she acts as a sounding board, offering cryptic advice and commentary – and her attempts to influence Juliet’s disposition, particularly her desire to understand Paris’s suitability, drive much of the emotional tension.  The Nurse's questioning of Paris's character – referencing a “valiant Paris” and the “obscured” in a volume of love – highlights the sense of veiled intrigue surrounding the relationship.\n\nA significant element of the narrative focuses on the idea that marriage is a strategic move, a way to secure the family’s wealth and social standing.  The Nurse’s observation that \"women grow by men\" underscores this perspective, suggesting that Juliet's future lies with a powerful and affluent man. The Nurse's detailed account of the marriage lineament, examining each feature of the prospective spouse, reflects a deep, almost obsessive, preoccupation with perfection and desirability.  The Nurse's repeated insistence on Juliet’s “prettiest babe” and her subsequent assessment of her as \"the prettiest babe that ever I nursed\" illustrates a preoccupation with the physical appearance of Juliet, which serves as a subtle (and potentially controlling) influence.\n\nThe passage effectively utilizes dramatic irony, creating suspense. The audience is privy to Juliet's growing anxiety and the Nurse’s manipulative attempts to understand her feelings, while Juliet herself remains veiled in her own thoughts and emotions.  The Nurse's lengthy, stream-of-consciousness monologue reveals her complex emotions—a mix of anxiety, affection, and a sense of duty—which becomes a character in itself. The visual imagery – the “wormwood to my dug” and the \"shake, quoth the dovehouse\" – creates a moment of intense emotional turmoil.  The contrast between the idyllic setting of the Capulet’s house and the dark, potentially chaotic scene outside – the servant’s arrival and the house's quiet atmosphere – emphasizes the gravity of the moment.\n\nThe concluding scene highlights the Nurse's powerful influence on Juliet, establishing the key plot point: Juliet's marriage to Paris is imminent and this section is critical to this turning point. The overall tone is one of mounting anxiety and anticipation, and the passage skillfully blends elements of drama, psychological suspense, and a poetic, almost archaic, style of language.",

Lady Capulet is preoccupied with her daughter, Juliet, and the matter of her impending marriage. Nurse, a pragmatic and slightly anxious presence, is tasked with ensuring Juliet’s presence at a scheduled meeting. The narrative swiftly establishes a sense of unease and a carefully constructed narrative – a backdrop of a long-held secret and a burgeoning drama.\n\nThe core of the scene revolves around the impending marriage of Juliet and Paris, a wealthy and charming nobleman. The Nurse’s insistent questioning of Juliet’s disposition towards Paris creates a tense dynamic; Juliet is visibly resistant, refusing to divulge her feelings. The Nurse's attempts to ascertain the truth through a detailed examination of Paris' character – particularly his face – is pivotal. The Nurse’s meticulous analysis of Paris’ features, examining every aspect of his appearance, reveals a calculated desire to uncover a hidden element of beauty and allure.  This underscores a sense of vanity and a focus on outward appearance as a key component of romantic attraction.\n\nThe passage highlights the historical context – a period of political tension in Verona, where the Capulets are embroiled in a feud with the Montagues. The scene contains a subtle, yet potent, foreshadowing of a conflict that will resonate throughout the play. The Nurse’s observation of the \"fish alive in the sea\" – a metaphor for the enduring allure of Paris – suggests a deep-seated yearning for a romantic escape. The Nurse's reflection on the value of beauty in marriage, and her own desire to be seen as 'no less' than beautiful, becomes a crucial point of contention. Juliet, sensing this subtle manipulation, expresses her desire for a quiet, agreeable marriage – a stark contrast to the whirlwind romance she anticipates.\n\nA significant element of the scene is the Nurse’s probing questions about Juliet's character and her feelings toward Paris.  The Nurse’s meticulous examination, framed as a strategic pursuit of wisdom, symbolizes a desire to understand Juliet's internal state. The Nurse’s repeated insistence on the importance of Juliet’s appearance—a deliberate and arguably manipulative tactic—adds a layer of anxiety and underscores the constraints placed on Juliet's life. The Nurse's subtle humor and playful teasing towards the Servant create a dynamic of anticipation and veiled threat.\n\nThe passage culminates in a series of observations by the Nurse, culminating in a final, deliberate revelation – a detailed examination of Paris’ face – which underscores the Nurse's calculated desire to uncover a secret that will ultimately define the narrative.  The servant’s abrupt departure adds a sense of urgency and impending doom, leaving the audience with a feeling of mounting tension and the knowledge that the secrets surrounding Juliet's fate are about to be unveiled. The overall tone shifts from a sense of quiet observation to one of carefully constructed suspense.",

        "final_summary": "***\n\nThe play opens in Capulet’s opulent house, with Lady Capulet and Nurse present. Juliet, a young woman, is summoned to the room, and the Nurse immediately begins to discuss Juliet’s impending marriage to Paris. The scene establishes a tense atmosphere, laden with foreshadowing and the weight of impending familial duty. Lady Capulet expresses her concern about Juliet’s well-being and the potential complications surrounding her marriage. The Nurse, a pragmatic and slightly melancholic figure, focuses on Juliet's age and the historical context of marriage – it's a matter of familial honor, and a seemingly insurmountable challenge to Juliet's future.\n\nThe Nurse’s conversation delves into the complexities of Juliet’s character, contrasting her youthful beauty with the expectations of Verona society. She emphasizes Juliet’s youth and the potential for a quick marriage, highlighting the pressure on her to fulfill a predetermined role. The Nurse’s anxieties, particularly regarding the “curse” of the library – a reference to the famous “curse of the apple” – suggest a superstitious element and an awareness of the potential negative consequences of marrying Paris.\n\nJuliet, in turn, expresses a sense of reluctance and a desire to avoid engagement, highlighting her desire for solitude and independence. The Nurse, however, pushes forward, emphasizing the historical significance of marriage – the “golden story” of Paris – and Juliet’s potential to be celebrated within Verona’s society. The Nurse skillfully crafts a persuasive argument regarding the value of marriage, using the imagery of a book – a metaphor for a carefully crafted narrative of love – and the “beauty’s pen” suggesting a meticulous and idealized examination of the potential match. She draws parallels between Juliet’s future and the historical story of Paris’ love, creating a deliberate juxtaposition of her present reality with a storied past.\n\nThe Nurse’s detailed observations of Paris – reading the volume of young Paris’ face – reveal a sophisticated and perhaps slightly obsessive interest in understanding the man. The Nurse’s words are laced with a subtle, almost theatrical, sense of observation and a hint of melancholy, framing the situation as a performance – a carefully orchestrated narrative. The Nurse’s final plea for Juliet to “seek happy nights to happy days” subtly underscores the emotional weight of her situation and her desire to avoid a life burdened by the potential of a marriage. The Servant’s arrival further underscores the sense of urgency and the impending storm of family drama.\n\nThe play is steeped in imagery – the \"wormwood\" symbolizes a threat or potential for bitterness – and it employs wordplay (\"By my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’\"), and subtly evokes a sense of impending doom through the mention of an earthquake and the looming presence of a long-ago “brain.”  The overall tone shifts from a cautionary narrative about marriage to a portrait of a young woman grappling with her destiny, driven by the forces of family expectations and the weight of a predetermined future. The language, while seemingly simple, carries an undeniable weight, reflecting the complex emotional landscape of the play.",

            "summary": "**A Shadow of Desire: A Sketch of a Street Scene**\n\nThe play opens in a bustling street, populated by masked figures – Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, and a handful of others – all seeking respite from the day. The atmosphere is one of subtle tension and anticipation, suggesting a burgeoning, possibly clandestine, attraction between Romeo and Juliet.\n\nRomeo, driven by a melancholy and a yearning for love, seeks company and a distraction from his perceived disappointments. Mercutio, a witty and cynical companion, challenges Romeo’s sentimentality, urging him to “dance” and avoid overly dramatic displays of affection.  Romeo, however, resists this urging, preferring a more subdued, contemplative approach.  The scene is punctuated by a seemingly random assortment of masks – grotesques, beetles, and others – that seem to serve as markers of the characters’ emotional states.\n\nThe encounter with the mysterious “Mab” – a figure instantly identified as a fairy – is the catalyst for the play’s central conflict. The Mab, depicted as a chaotic, energetic being with a strange and unsettling appearance, embodies the unpredictable and passionate nature of desire. It arrives in a flurry of movement, seemingly to delight in chaos and disorientation. The Mab's appearance is accompanied by a series of bizarre and illogical events: the beetle-brows on the visor, the spider’s web, and the moonshine-infused “waggoner” – all elements that contribute to a sense of dreamlike disorientation and a disruption of the ordinary. \n\nThe Mab's chaotic presence seems to be a manifestation of the characters’ own subconscious desires, and a potent metaphor for the intense and fleeting nature of love. The play details a series of fragmented and increasingly bizarre dreams, all hinting at the intense emotional turmoil of Romeo and Juliet. The dreams, starting with a slumbering Romeo and a fleeting dream of a queen, quickly escalate into a nightmarish depiction of a tempestuous, unpredictable love affair. The scene establishes the underlying sense of danger and instability that will drive the narrative.\n\nBenvolio attempts to mediate the situation and offer a pragmatic approach, urging Romeo to focus on his own desires, and to avoid appearing overly dramatic. However, Romeo's insistence on a measured, contemplative approach – a stark contrast to the Mab’s erratic energy – begins to fuel the conflict. \n\nThe arrival of the Mab – and the subsequent disruption of the street – symbolizes a disruption of the normal, predictable order of the characters' lives.  The stage directions of Romeo to “seek peace, peace, Romeo, peace” are a desperate attempt to ground himself amidst the unsettling events. \n\nThe play culminates with Romeo’s declaration of impending doom, the implication that his fate is sealed by his love for Juliet. The final images – the Mab’s carriage, the beetle-brows, and the spider’s web – establish a deeply symbolic and unsettling dreamscape, further enhancing the play's sense of unease and the blurring of reality and illusion. The entire scene is imbued with a feeling of impending doom and a heightened sense of magical disruption.",

            "summary": "Here’s a detailed summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text's content, with modern prose and attention to key elements:\n\nThe play opens with Romeo, Mercutio, and Benvolio – a group of masked characters – entering a bustling street. They are ostensibly seeking an excuse to continue a clandestine meeting, but the atmosphere is charged with a sense of impending trouble. Romeo, feeling pressured, expresses his reluctance, while Mercutio, ever the playful catalyst, pushes for action.  The scene establishes a dramatic atmosphere of anticipation and a subtle undercurrent of a larger, potentially perilous plot.\n\nThe core conflict revolves around Romeo’s longing for a passionate romance. He’s consumed by a desire to experience love, but he’s weighed down by the potential for heartbreak.  He’s attempting to subtly sabotage his own involvement in a potentially disastrous situation – a match with Juliet, a young woman he desperately desires.  Mercutio, acting as a foil, is focused on the potential downsides of romantic pursuit, highlighting the risks and complications involved.  The mention of Cupid and a \"tartar's painted bow\" sets a whimsical but ominous tone, suggesting a potentially fraught encounter.\n\nThe characters’ conversation progresses through a series of witty exchanges. Romeo is increasingly melancholic and resigned to his fate, contemplating the difficulty of achieving his desires.  Mercutio, predictably, seeks to entertain the audience with his rapid-fire, almost nonsensical, commentary.  The dialogue is filled with puns, wordplay, and a slightly frantic energy – mirroring Romeo’s internal turmoil.  The “mask” is a key symbolic element, representing the hiding of true feelings and the difficulty of confronting one's desires. \n\nThe passage progresses with a somewhat surreal and theatrical sequence of events. Romeo dreams of a vision – a nightmarish dreamscape – featuring a regal figure (Queen Mab) with fantastical appearance. This dream serves as a catalyst for his obsessive thoughts and anxieties. It establishes the scene’s bizarre, almost fairy-tale, setting.  The inclusion of insects – beetles, spiders, and other crawling creatures – amplifies the sense of unease and the bizarre, otherworldly nature of the dream. The imagery of the “wagon-spokes,” “lashes,” and “whistle” further reinforces this unsettling aesthetic. \n\nThe eventual decision to “burn daylight” underscores the characters’ desire to escape a situation that feels increasingly fraught.  The phrase \"a candle-holder and look on\" hints at a significant and perhaps tragic event to come. The mention of \"courtiers' knees,\" \"lawyers' fingers,\" and “ladies' lips” further underscores the scope and gravity of what’s about to unfold. \n\nThe final exchange is a masterful display of dramatic tension – a rapid volley of insults and attempts to throw the characters off balance. The scene culminates with a palpable sense of impending doom, establishing the setup for the tragic events to follow. The opening lines – \"Peace, peace, Romeo, peace, Thou talk’st of nothing\" – signify the beginning of a significant crisis and the weight of the characters' predicament.\n\nIn essence, the passage uses a blend of witty dialogue, surreal imagery, and symbolic motifs to create a sense of impending drama and a deeply uncomfortable situation. It’s a carefully crafted setup that leaves the audience wondering what consequences will arise from Romeo’s impulsive actions.",

            "summary": "Okay, here’s a modern English summary of the passage, aiming for a balance of key elements, emotional tone, and literary analysis – approximately 60-70% of the original text’s content:\n\n**The Play: A Night of Mischief and a Dream**\n\nThe play opens with Romeo, Mercutio, and Benvolio, a group of masked characters, arriving at a lavishly decorated street. They’re here to throw a party, ostensibly for a celebration, but with a distinctly chaotic and playful energy. Romeo is preoccupied with a sense of impending doom – a difficult speech he’s about to deliver – and is subtly pushing back against the expected formalities.  Mercutio, eager to be involved, is constantly attempting to amuse Romeo, and Benvolio offers practical advice, acting as a counterbalance to Romeo's restlessness.\n\nThe central conflict revolves around Romeo’s obsessive infatuation with Rosaline, a woman he deeply loves but cannot secure a relationship with. The stage is set for a dramatic collision between his desire and the constraints of society – the “prolixity” of the date –  that prevents him from pursuing his ideal. Romeo believes he needs to \"measure\" his love by the attraction of others, implying he's prioritizing appearances over genuine connection.\n\nAs the play progresses, Mercutio becomes increasingly drawn into the chaotic atmosphere. He delights in disrupting the established order with his witty remarks, acting as a catalyst for the play’s unfolding chaos. The scene is filled with surreal imagery – images of a bizarre, oversized beetle-brow mask, an elderly man with a tiny, shimmering caterpillar’s tail, and an empty hazelnut chariot – all reflecting the strange and dreamlike nature of Romeo’s obsession.  The “hag” – a figure representing the Fairy realm – is a key element, appearing in fragmented, suggestive forms to symbolize the dreamy, illogical nature of Romeo's thoughts. \n\nRomeo's dreams – detailed and often bizarre – are crucial to the narrative. They represent his internal turmoil and a desperate attempt to escape the reality of his situation.  He is plagued by anxieties about his future and the potential consequences of his choices. \n\nThe scene culminates in a flurry of activity, a chaotic dance of masked figures, and a significant disruption of the established order. Romeo, consumed by his thoughts and anxieties, makes a crucial decision – he will give a speech – driven by a desperate need to deliver a statement of sorts. The play’s tone shifts from a carefully constructed, almost formal, atmosphere to one of frenetic energy and unrest.\n\nThe resolution of the scene leaves the audience hanging – we see the consequences of Romeo's actions and the unsettling atmosphere of his dream world, setting the stage for further events. The ending is brief, a stark note of impending disaster, reinforcing the theme of fate and the dreamlike nature of the characters' internal struggles.\n\n**Key Literary Devices & References:**\n\n*   **Symbolism:** The beetle-brow mask, the hazelnut chariot, the fairy's coach – all serve as symbolic representations of the characters' inner conflicts and the chaotic nature of their dreams.\n*   **Imagery:** The descriptions of the mask, the tiny spider's web, and the scattered images create a visual, almost hallucinatory, atmosphere.\n*   **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between the formal, polished setting and the surreal, dreamlike imagery highlights the disconnect between Romeo’s desires and reality.\n*   **Wordplay & Wit:** Mercutio's clever remarks are essential to establishing the play's comedic tone and providing moments of sharp observation.\n*   **Unreliable Narrator (Somewhat):** Romeo's dream sequences, while presented as intensely personal, introduce a subjective element of uncertainty, blurring the line between reality and illusion.\n\nI’ve focused on capturing the core essence of the passage – the themes of desire, obsession, and the blurring of reality – while preserving the original text’s stylistic elements and emotional weight.",

        "final_summary": "Here’s a detailed summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text's content, with modern prose and attention to key elements:\n\nThe play opens with Romeo, Mercutio, and Benvolio – a group of masked characters – entering a bustling street. They are ostensibly seeking an excuse to continue a clandestine meeting, but the atmosphere is charged with a sense of impending trouble. Romeo, feeling pressured, expresses his reluctance, while Mercutio, ever the playful catalyst, pushes for action.  The scene establishes a dramatic atmosphere of anticipation and a subtle undercurrent of a larger, potentially perilous plot.\n\nThe core conflict revolves around Romeo’s longing for a passionate romance. He’s consumed by a desire to experience love, but he’s weighed down by the potential for heartbreak.  He’s attempting to subtly sabotage his own involvement in a potentially disastrous situation – a match with Juliet, a young woman he desperately desires.  Mercutio, acting as a foil, is focused on the potential downsides of romantic pursuit, highlighting the risks and complications involved.  The mention of Cupid and a \"tartar's painted bow\" sets a whimsical but ominous tone, suggesting a potentially fraught encounter.\n\nThe characters’ conversation progresses through a series of witty exchanges. Romeo is increasingly melancholic and resigned to his fate, contemplating the difficulty of achieving his desires.  Mercutio, predictably, seeks to entertain the audience with his rapid-fire, almost nonsensical, commentary.  The dialogue is filled with puns, wordplay, and a slightly frantic energy – mirroring Romeo’s internal turmoil.  The “mask” is a key symbolic element, representing the hiding of true feelings and the difficulty of confronting one's desires. \n\nThe passage progresses with a somewhat surreal and theatrical sequence of events. Romeo dreams of a vision – a nightmarish dreamscape – featuring a regal figure (Queen Mab) with fantastical appearance. This dream serves as a catalyst for his obsessive thoughts and anxieties. It establishes the scene’s bizarre, almost fairy-tale, setting.  The inclusion of insects – beetles, spiders, and other crawling creatures – amplifies the sense of unease and the bizarre, otherworldly nature of the dream. The imagery of the “wagon-spokes,” “lashes,” and “whistle” further reinforces this unsettling aesthetic. \n\nThe eventual decision to “burn daylight” underscores the characters’ desire to escape a situation that feels increasingly fraught.  The phrase \"a candle-holder and look on\" hints at a significant and perhaps tragic event to come. The mention of \"courtiers' knees,\" \"lawyers' fingers,\" and “ladies' lips” further underscores the scope and gravity of what’s about to unfold. \n\nThe final exchange is a masterful display of dramatic tension – a rapid volley of insults and attempts to throw the characters off balance. The scene culminates with a palpable sense of impending doom, establishing the setup for the tragic events to follow. The opening lines – \"Peace, peace, Romeo, peace, Thou talk’st of nothing\" – signify the beginning of a significant crisis and the weight of the characters' predicament.\n\nIn essence, the passage uses a blend of witty dialogue, surreal imagery, and symbolic motifs to create a sense of impending drama and a deeply uncomfortable situation. It’s a carefully crafted setup that leaves the audience wondering what consequences will arise from Romeo’s impulsive actions.",

The scene establishes a heightened atmosphere of anticipation and veiled tension.  Initially, the focus is on the rivalry between Antony (Romeo’s cousin) and Potpan, a young servant who’s preoccupied with polishing and scraping.

            "summary": "Here’s a summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original length, incorporating key themes, character motivations, plot points, and literary significance, while maintaining a modern prose style:\n\n**A Rising Tension – A Capulet Courtly Dance**\n\nThe play opens with a gathering of prominent figures in Verona, orchestrated by the Capulet family. Romeo and Juliet, two young lovers from rival houses, are drawn to each other amidst a lavish celebration. The scene establishes a palpable sense of impending doom and a desperate attempt to avert a disastrous alliance between the Montagues and Capulets.\n\n**The Core Conflict & Relationships:** The central conflict revolves around the forbidden love between Romeo and Juliet, fueled by their families’ longstanding feud. The play quickly establishes the weight of this animosity – it’s not merely a simple disagreement but a deeply rooted and destructive history. Romeo, a Montague, is instantly captivated by Juliet, a Capulet. This burgeoning love is immediately complicated by the families’ hatred; a crucial element is the tension between the two families. The play establishes a clear dynamic where the lovers are essentially caught in the crossfire of familial conflict. The Nurse, a supportive figure, attempts to shield Juliet from the realities of her social standing while also harboring her affection. \n\n**The Roles of Key Characters:** Romeo is driven by an impulsive, romantic desire, and this contrasts with the cautious and pragmatic Nurse, who understands the danger of his pursuit. Tybalt, Romeo’s older brother and Capulet’s elder brother, is present and warns against the risk of their love. Romeo’s reaction to Tybalt’s presence underscores the consequences of pursuing a love that threatens the established order. The Nurse serves as an essential moral compass, subtly guiding Juliet while also harboring a complicated affection for her.\n\n**The Wedding & Plot Thickens:** The play focuses on the preparations for the Capulet wedding, which is intended to solidify the alliance between the Montagues and Capulets. The focus shifts to a dramatic chase orchestrated by the Nurse – a frantic attempt to prevent Romeo and Juliet from meeting. This highlights the dangers of their love, presented through the heightened tension created by the unfolding events. \n\n**Symbolism & Imagery:** The passage utilizes evocative imagery to convey the play’s mood. The “snowy dove” and “ethiopian ear” imagery, especially the comparison of beauty with a “rich jewel,” creates a sense of delicate and precarious attraction. The music itself is a central element; it’s presented as a “whispering tale” – a signal of impending trouble, contributing to a feeling of foreboding.\n\n**Character Motivation & Reactions:**  Romeo’s impulsive nature and desire for immediate connection are highlighted, while Juliet’s longing for freedom and escape from her family's pressure are subtly suggested through her guarded nature. Juliet’s desperation to avoid the consequences of her love creates a profound emotional tension. The Nurse acts as a mediator, skillfully navigating the situation and attempting to protect Juliet.\n\n**The Turning Point – A Fatal Choice:** The encounter between Romeo and Juliet, and the subsequent tragic consequences, are vividly depicted. The opening scene emphasizes the intensity of their love, suggesting a dangerous and irreversible bond. The “sinful” act of kissing, foreshadowing a tragic end, becomes the pivotal moment that dictates the direction of the story.\n\n**The Ending – A Desperate Dance:** The play culminates in a bittersweet moment – Romeo and Juliet’s doomed romance, culminating in their tragic deaths. The final scene emphasizes the chaotic consequences of their actions, a final confrontation culminating in a devastating finality. The final image of the Nurse, anticipating the inevitable, reinforces the play’s themes of fate and the consequences of love. The overall effect is a dramatic and melancholy portrayal of youthful passion and the destructive nature of societal hatred. \n\n**Overall Tone & Literary Significance:** The passage masterfully blends elements of romance, tragedy, and political intrigue. The language, particularly the use of archaic phrases (like “a whispering tale”) and imagery, creates a sense of Shakespearean era. The dramatic tone and symbolic elements elevate the scene beyond a simple love story, establishing a larger narrative about the destructive consequences of conflict and the intoxicating power of love.",

My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. You say you do not know the lady’s mind. Uneven is the course; I like it not. PARIS. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death, And therefore have I little talk’d of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage, To stop the inundation of her tears, Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. [_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.— Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. Enter Juliet. PARIS. Happily met, my lady and my wife! JULIET. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. PARIS. That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next. JULIET. What must be shall be. FRIAR LAWRENCE. That’s a certain text. PARIS. Come you to make confession to this father? JULIET. To answer that, I should confess to you. PARIS. Do not deny to him that you love me. JULIET. I will confess to you that I love him. PARIS. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. JULIET. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back than to your face. PARIS. Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears. JULIET. The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite. PARIS. Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report. JULIET. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face. PARIS. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it. JULIET. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Are you at leisure, holy father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass? FRIAR LAWRENCE. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone. PARIS. God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye, Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. [_Exit._] JULIET. O shut the door, and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help! FRIAR LAWRENCE. O Juliet, I already know thy grief; It strains me past the compass of my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County. JULIET. Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently. God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time, Give me some present counsel, or behold ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring. Be not so long to speak. I long to die, If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop’st with death himself to scape from it. And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy. JULIET. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower, Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears; Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house, O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls. Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble, And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow; Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest, The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall, Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part depriv’d of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it. JULIET. Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear! FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. JULIET. Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear father. [_Exeunt._]",

        "input_content": "Here’s a comprehensive, detailed summary of the passage, maintaining the core themes, character motivations, and literary significance, while adhering to the specified length and tone:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe play opens with a tense scene at a churchyard, where Romeo and Balthasar, a messenger, are summoned to deliver a message to the Capulet family.  Paris, a Montague, arrives with a torch, setting a volatile atmosphere.  The conversation quickly escalates as Romeo reveals his desperate feelings for Juliet, a Capulet widow.  Driven by his love, Romeo attempts to secretly woo Juliet, leading to a confrontation and a violent fight.  The Prince, a Montague, arrives, agitated by the commotion and vows to restore order.  The plot thickens as Romeo is implicated in Juliet's death, further fueling the conflict between the families.  A frantic Friar Lawrence arrives with a message of urgency, revealing Romeo's desperate attempt to deliver the message.  The play focuses on the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet's doomed love, illustrating the destructive consequences of their forbidden union and the power of fate. \n\n**Key Themes and Elements:**\n\n*   **Forbidden Love:** The central theme is the agonizing conflict between love and familial duty, particularly within the context of a divided society. Romeo and Juliet’s love defies the established social order, leading to their tragic end.\n*   **Fate vs. Free Will:** The tragedy raises questions about whether Romeo and Juliet’s love is predetermined or if their choices are ultimately shaped by fate. Their love is passionate and intense, suggesting an inevitable outcome, yet their actions also contribute to their demise.\n*   **Violence and Tragedy:** The play employs dramatic irony and foreshadowing to create suspense. The murder of Romeo and Juliet is the focal point, highlighting the consequences of their actions. The events are set in a time of political and familial conflict, adding to the tragedy.\n*   **Appearance vs. Reality:**  The characters' outward appearances are often misleading. Romeo and Juliet's love is idealized, masking underlying tensions and betrayals. The play explores how appearances can be deceiving and how easily people can be manipulated. \n*   **The Power of Language:** The use of words and phrases – like “star-crossed lovers” – underscores the theme of fate and the inability to escape destiny. The language itself becomes a symbol of the characters’ predicament. \n\n\n**Character Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Romeo:** A passionate, romantic, and impulsive young man consumed by love. He's driven by idealistic emotion and is willing to risk everything for his beloved.\n*   **Juliet:** A beautiful, intelligent, and dutiful young woman who initially resists the arranged marriage, but ultimately chooses love over societal expectations.\n*   **Paris:** A dutiful and cautious Montague, he is a representative of the political tensions.\n*   **Friar Lawrence:** A wise and somewhat eccentric friar who provides crucial support and guidance for Romeo, but ultimately fails to prevent the tragedy. \n*   **The Prince:** Represents the authority of the monarchy. \n\n**Narrative Structure and Tone:**\n\nThe play is structured as a series of rapidly-developing scenes, which create a sense of urgency and impending doom. The tone is elevated and dramatic, using heightened language and imagery to reflect the characters' emotional turmoil. The play's dialogue is sharp and full of wit, revealing characters' personalities and motivations.  The shifting perspectives, as recounted by the characters, contribute to the play’s overall sense of tragedy and uncertainty.\n\n**Overall Significance:**\n\n* *Romeo and Juliet* remains one of the most iconic love stories in literature, showcasing a potent exploration of themes of destiny, passion, and the destructive power of conflict. The play's themes and enduring popularity demonstrate a cultural fascination with the struggle between love and societal constraints.",

        "original_content": "Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch. PARIS. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof. Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground; So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear’st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. PAGE. [_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [_Retires._] PARIS. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones, Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans. The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. [_The Page whistles._] The boy gives warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way tonight, To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite? What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile. [_Retires._] Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c. ROMEO. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father. Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady’s face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. BALTHASAR. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. ROMEO. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow. BALTHASAR. For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout. His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [_Retires_] ROMEO. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, [_Breaking open the door of the monument._] And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food. PARIS. This is that banish’d haughty Montague That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,— And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. [_Advances._] Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague. Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. Obey, and go with me, for thou must die. ROMEO. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man. Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury. O be gone. By heaven I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm’d against myself. Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say, A madman’s mercy bid thee run away. PARIS. I do defy thy conjuration, And apprehend thee for a felon here. ROMEO. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy! [_They fight._] PAGE. O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. [_Exit._] PARIS. O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [_Dies._] ROMEO. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris! What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book. I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d. [_Laying Paris in the monument._] How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! Which their keepers call A lightning before death. O, how may I Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife, Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death’s pale flag is not advanced there. Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again. Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest; And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide. Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark. Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. [_Dies._] Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a lantern, crow, and spade. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there? Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead? BALTHASAR. Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, It burneth in the Capels’ monument. BALTHASAR. It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master, One that you love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who is it? BALTHASAR. Romeo. FRIAR LAWRENCE. How long hath he been there? BALTHASAR. Full half an hour. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Go with me to the vault. BALTHASAR. I dare not, sir; My master knows not but I am gone hence, And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. BALTHASAR. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Romeo! [_Advances._] Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour’d by this place of peace? [_Enters the monument._] Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance? The lady stirs. [_Juliet wakes and stirs._] JULIET. O comfortable Friar, where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo? [_Noise within._] FRIAR LAWRENCE. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. JULIET. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. [_Exit Friar Lawrence._] What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative. [_Kisses him._] Thy lips are warm! FIRST WATCH. [_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way? JULIET. Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger. [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._] This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die. [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._] Enter Watch with the Page of Paris. PAGE. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. FIRST WATCH. The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach. [_Exeunt some of the Watch._] Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues, some others search. [_Exeunt others of the Watch._] We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar. SECOND WATCH. Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard. FIRST WATCH. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence. THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side. FIRST WATCH. A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too. Enter the Prince and Attendants. PRINCE. What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning’s rest? Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others. CAPULET. What should it be that they so shriek abroad? LADY CAPULET. O the people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run With open outcry toward our monument. PRINCE. What fear is this which startles in our ears? FIRST WATCH. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill’d. PRINCE. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. FIRST WATCH. Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs. CAPULET. O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom. LADY CAPULET. O me! This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre. Enter Montague and others. PRINCE. Come, Montague, for thou art early up, To see thy son and heir more early down. MONTAGUE. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age? PRINCE. Look, and thou shalt see. MONTAGUE. O thou untaught! What manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave? PRINCE. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience. Bring forth the parties of suspicion. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus’d. PRINCE. Then say at once what thou dost know in this. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; and their stol’n marriage day Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow’d grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight Return’d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law. PRINCE. We still have known thee for a holy man. Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this? BALTHASAR. I brought my master news of Juliet’s death, And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not, and left him there. PRINCE. Give me the letter, I will look on it. Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place? PAGE. He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch. PRINCE. This letter doth make good the Friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d. CAPULET. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand. MONTAGUE. But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. CAPULET. As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity. PRINCE. A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",

The scene establishes a palpable sense of urgency and impending doom, fueled by the chilling imagery of time and the relentless passage of hours. The Nurse, a pragmatic and somewhat weary character, immediately attempts to soothe Juliet’s distress, offering a mixture of comforting reassurance and veiled warnings about Romeo’s potential departure. The Nurse’s observations of the sun’s trajectory – “driving back shadows over lowering hills” – foreshadow a pivotal moment in the narrative. \n\nThe arrival of Peter, the Nurse’s servant, immediately creates a sense of unease and foreboding. Peter’s frantic and repetitive behavior – “stay at the gate” – suggests a deep preoccupation with duty and a lack of urgency, mirroring Juliet’s own internal struggle. The Nurse’s increasingly pointed questions about Romeo’s well-being—“Hast thou met with him?”—intensifies the tension, suggesting a desperate attempt to regain control of the situation. \n\nJuliet’s agitated responses – “Why look’st thou sad?” – reveal her emotional turmoil and a palpable anxiety.  The passage emphasizes the symbolic weight of the time – “three long hours” – highlighting the crucial window of opportunity for Romeo's return.  The imagery of “nimble-pinion’d doves” suggests a carefully orchestrated plan, further emphasizing the significance of the impending meeting.  The Nurse’s description of Romeo as “past compare” – “gentle as a lamb” – suggests a contrasting image, emphasizing Romeo’s perceived lack of sophistication or courtesy.\n\nThe Nurse’s insistent instructions to Juliet to “speak” and “make a choice” heighten the stakes, subtly directing Juliet’s actions. The Nurse’s veiled warning about Romeo’s “leg” – “exceeds all men’s” – further underscores the seriousness of the situation. The Nurse’s description of Romeo’s “face be better than any man’s” – “though his leg excels all men’s” – is a striking and symbolic contrast, highlighting Romeo’s physical prowess while simultaneously emphasizing his potential for a romantic connection. \n\nThe Nurse’s cryptic message – “Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while?” – injects a layer of dramatic irony, hinting at the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences of inaction.  The Nurse’s overall delivery— “I am aweary, give me leave awhile” – conveys a feeling of weary resignation and a desire to avoid the drama. \n\nThe concluding lines – “Here’s such a coil.” and “Hie you to church.” – underscore Juliet’s emotional state, hinting at a descent into desperation and a willingness to embrace the situation, even at the cost of her own peace. The overall tone is one of mounting suspense and impending disaster, underscored by the imagery of time and the physical manifestation of the impending tragedy. The passage powerfully blends dramatic irony – the audience knows more than the characters – with symbolic imagery – mirroring the themes of love, fate, and the precariousness of happiness.",

O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over lowering hills: Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love, And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come. Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She’d be as swift in motion as a ball; My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me. But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. Enter Nurse and Peter. O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news? Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. NURSE. Peter, stay at the gate. [_Exit Peter._] JULIET. Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad? Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face. NURSE. I am aweary, give me leave awhile; Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had! JULIET. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak. NURSE. Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am out of breath? JULIET. How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that; Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance. Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad? NURSE. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home? JULIET. No, no. But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? What of that? NURSE. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I! It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back! Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jauncing up and down. JULIET. I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love? NURSE. Your love says like an honest gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother? JULIET. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest. ‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman, ‘Where is your mother?’ NURSE. O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow. Is this the poultice for my aching bones? Henceforward do your messages yourself. JULIET. Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo? NURSE. Have you got leave to go to shrift today? JULIET. I have. NURSE. Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife. Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news. Hie you to church. I must another way, To fetch a ladder by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark. I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; But you shall bear the burden soon at night. Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell. JULIET. Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell. [_Exeunt._]",

        "input_content": "Okay, here’s a summary of that passage, aiming for a deep engagement with the text while maintaining a modern sensibility and focusing on the core elements:\n\n“The Capulet household breathes a heavy, anxious air. A grand hall, bathed in a sickly yellow light, holds a gathering of the most bitter rivals – the Montagues and the Capulets.  It’s a scene steeped in a long-standing, simmering resentment, a powder keg waiting for a spark.  Our protagonist, Juliet, is clearly agitated, pacing like a caged bird, her face a mask of controlled distress.\n\nThe central conflict isn’t a grand battle, but a slow, agonizing erosion of trust. Romeo, the Montague, is relentlessly pursuing Juliet. He’s not offering a passionate declaration of love, but a calculated, almost obsessive pursuit – a desperate game of cat and mouse. He’s drawn to her like a moth to a flame, but his intentions are far from benevolent.  He’s not *loving* her; he's staking a claim, trying to force a connection that’s already fundamentally fractured.\n\nJuliet’s parents, Lord and Lady Capulet, are acutely aware of the fallout. Their carefully constructed facade of familial harmony is crumbling. The atmosphere is thick with unspoken accusations and veiled threats.  The silence between them speaks volumes – a history of power struggles and betrayals.  \n\nRomeo, driven by a potent mix of youthful impulsiveness and a baffling melancholy, is deliberately provoking Juliet’s emotions. He’s projecting a desperate, almost tragic image – a figure caught between her own will and the weighty expectations of her family. His behavior suggests a profound, if misguided, yearning for something beyond the confines of their established world.\n\nThe imagery is particularly poignant:  the flickering candlelight casts long, distorted shadows, hinting at hidden secrets and veiled intentions.  The scene suggests a delicate balance – a precarious truce threatened by a single, impulsive action.  There's a sense that this pursuit of Romeo will irrevocably damage the already strained relationship between the families. It’s a slow, creeping descent into a dangerous moral abyss.  Ultimately, the passage portrays a tragedy not of violent conflict, but of a love so profound it threatens to consume everything around it.”",

        "input_content": "Here’s a comprehensive, detailed summary of the passage, maintaining all key themes, character motivations, plot points, and literary significance, while incorporating specific details and a modern prose style:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe play opens with Sampson and Gregory, two ambitious young men, arriving at the Montague household. Their presence is immediately charged with a simmering tension and a subtle power struggle. The scene establishes the central conflict: Sampson and Gregory are vying for the favor of the Montague family, particularly the affections of Juliet, the daughter of Capulet. The argument focuses on Sampson's desire to “take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s,” a blatant act of aggression and a symbolic demonstration of his dominance.\n\nThe dialogue escalates, revealing the men's intertwined plans to disrupt Capulet’s peace and seize control of the household. Sampson’s provocative remarks and strategic planning – using his words to undermine Capulet’s authority – are central to the plot. Gregory, attempting to counter Sampson's intent, engages in a subtle but effective defense, setting up a dramatic confrontation. \n\nThe scene culminates in a fierce and protracted argument between Sampson and Gregory. Sampson escalates to the point of attempting to incite a physical fight, demonstrating his ruthlessness and willingness to use force to achieve his goals. Gregory counters with a desperate attempt to thwart Sampson’s plans, employing cunning and a measured strategy. The fight itself becomes a catalyst for revealing the complex motivations of the characters – Sampson's ambition, Gregory’s desire for a chance at a positive outcome, and the underlying tension between these men.\n\nAs the fight progresses, the play hints at a deeper conflict within the Montague household. The characters are driven by a complex web of love, rivalry, and political maneuvering. The focus shifts to the emotional stakes – the potential ramifications of a fractured family and the consequences of a miscalculated maneuver.\n\nThe arrival of Prince Escalus adds another layer of importance. His presence emphasizes the repercussions of the feud between the Montagues and Capulets, and underscores the significance of the conflict in Verona.\n\nThe play’s conclusion involves a dramatic confrontation between Sampson and Gregory, highlighting their rivalry and the stakes of their conflict. The unresolved conflict – the need to resolve the feud and potentially manipulate the situation – provides a clear direction for the narrative. Ultimately, the scene serves as a distillation of the play's themes of ambition, rivalry, and the destructive consequences of unchecked desire.\n\n**Literary Significance & Contextual Notes:**\n\n*   **Shakespearean Devices:** The passage utilizes several Shakespearean stylistic elements:\n    *   **Metaphor:** “The wall of any man or maid” is a powerful metaphor representing Sampson’s desire to control and dominate.\n    *   **Imagery:** The fight scene is filled with vivid imagery (the sword, the “fiery Tybalt,” the “dark smoke”).\n    *   **Dramatic Irony:** The audience is aware of the characters' ambitions and manipulations, creating a sense of tension and anticipation.\n    *   **Soliloquy/Aside:** Gregory’s “Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar” and Sampson’s “I strike quickly, being moved” are examples of soliloquies, revealing inner thoughts and motivations to the audience.\n*   **Character Motivation:** Sampson’s ambition and desire for a \"better\" life are clearly at the heart of the scene. Gregory’s actions suggest a desire for a chance to avoid or mitigate the pain of the feud.\n*   **Thematic Focus:** The scene highlights the destructive consequences of rivalry and the importance of controlling one’s own desires. It centers on the tension and potential for tragedy that arises when individuals prioritize personal ambition over the well-being of others and family.",

True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. GREGORY. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. SAMPSON. ’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads. GREGORY. The heads of the maids? SAMPSON. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt. GREGORY. They must take it in sense that feel it. SAMPSON. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. GREGORY. ’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues. Enter Abram and Balthasar. SAMPSON. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. GREGORY. How? Turn thy back and run? SAMPSON. Fear me not. GREGORY. No, marry; I fear thee! SAMPSON. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. GREGORY. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. SAMPSON. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it. ABRAM. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON. I do bite my thumb, sir. ABRAM. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON. Is the law of our side if I say ay? GREGORY. No. SAMPSON. No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir. GREGORY. Do you quarrel, sir? ABRAM. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. SAMPSON. But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you. ABRAM. No better. SAMPSON. Well, sir. Enter Benvolio. GREGORY. Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen. SAMPSON. Yes, better, sir. ABRAM. You lie. SAMPSON. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow. [_They fight._] BENVOLIO. Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do. [_Beats down their swords._] Enter Tybalt. TYBALT. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death. BENVOLIO. I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me. TYBALT. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: Have at thee, coward. [_They fight._] Enter three or four Citizens with clubs. FIRST CITIZEN. Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down! Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet. CAPULET. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! LADY CAPULET. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? CAPULET. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Enter Montague and his Lady Montague. MONTAGUE. Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go. LADY MONTAGUE. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants. PRINCE. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,— Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground And hear the sentence of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets, And made Verona’s ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate. If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time all the rest depart away: You, Capulet, shall go along with me, And Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our farther pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgement-place. Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt, Citizens and Servants._] MONTAGUE. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? BENVOLIO. Here were the servants of your adversary And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. I drew to part them, in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d, Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears, He swung about his head, and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part. LADY MONTAGUE. O where is Romeo, saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. BENVOLIO. Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun Peer’d forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad, Where underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me. MONTAGUE. Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove. BENVOLIO. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? MONTAGUE. I neither know it nor can learn of him. BENVOLIO. Have you importun’d him by any means? MONTAGUE. Both by myself and many other friends; But he, his own affections’ counsellor, Is to himself—I will not say how true— But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter Romeo. BENVOLIO. See, where he comes. So please you step aside; I’ll know his grievance or be much denied. MONTAGUE. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away, [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._] BENVOLIO. Good morrow, cousin. ROMEO. Is the day so young? BENVOLIO. But new struck nine. ROMEO. Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast? BENVOLIO. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours? ROMEO. Not having that which, having, makes them short. BENVOLIO. In love? ROMEO. Out. BENVOLIO. Of love? ROMEO. Out of her favour where I am in love. BENVOLIO. Alas that love so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. ROMEO. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? BENVOLIO. No coz, I rather weep. ROMEO. Good heart, at what? BENVOLIO. At thy good heart’s oppression. ROMEO. Why such is love’s transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears: What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Farewell, my coz. [_Going._] BENVOLIO. Soft! I will go along: And if you leave me so, you do me wrong. ROMEO. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here. This is not Romeo, he’s some other where. BENVOLIO. Tell me in sadness who is that you love? ROMEO. What, shall I groan and tell thee? BENVOLIO. Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who. ROMEO. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will, A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill. In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. BENVOLIO. I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d. ROMEO. A right good markman, and she’s fair I love. BENVOLIO. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. ROMEO. Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit; And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d, From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d. She will not stay the siege of loving terms Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: O she’s rich in beauty, only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store. BENVOLIO. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? ROMEO. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; For beauty starv’d with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead, that live to tell it now. BENVOLIO. Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her. ROMEO. O teach me how I should forget to think. BENVOLIO. By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. ROMEO. ’Tis the way To call hers, exquisite, in question more. These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair; He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair? Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget. BENVOLIO. I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. [_Exeunt._]",

        "input_content": "Okay, here’s a modern-language summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text's essence, while maintaining Shakespearean tone, thematic depth, and literary significance:\n\n**A Bitter Rivalry and a Promise of Love**\n\nThe play opens with Capulet, Paris, and their servant, all gathered at a lavishly decorated street feast, ostensibly a celebration of the season. The atmosphere is charged with a palpable tension – Capulet is deeply concerned about a looming obligation, a weighty marriage penalty passed down through generations, and the impending marriage of his child to a wealthy, eligible man. Paris, displaying an air of dignified expectation, is keenly aware of the significance of the occasion and the potential for a favorable match. The Servant, a nervous observer, is tasked with managing the guest list and ensuring the feast’s success.\n\nThe core conflict revolves around Capulet’s desperate desire to secure a marriage alliance – a marriage that will solidify his family’s position and ensure the continuation of a carefully crafted lineage. He’s acutely aware of the social pressures and the historical weight of the arrangement, framing it as a necessary step for his child’s future. The “old accustomd feast” signifies a moment of indulgence and a concentrated display of wealth and potential alliances, which Capulet desperately wants to maintain. \n\nParis, despite his reservations, is presented with an opportunity to alleviate his anxieties. He recognizes the potential for a prosperous marriage and offers a calculated appeal, suggesting that a strategic match – one that will generate significant social prestige – could secure his family's future.\n\nRomeo, a young and passionate man, is drawn to Rosaline, a beautiful and captivating woman. He’s consumed by a desire to impress and to secure the attention of a woman who embodies a perfect, unattainable ideal – a woman whose face holds the promise of beauty and the promise of a marriage alliance.  Romeo, desperate and consumed by love, is driven by a desire for a fleeting and idealized moment of admiration. \n\nThe Servant, performing his assigned task of gathering information – a crucial detail for Capulet – is tasked with discovering the names of the guests. The details of these guests are a swirling collection of prominent individuals from Verona’s social circles: the shoemaker, the tailor, the fisher, the painter, and even the family of Capulet, a rich and powerful lineage. The Servant's meticulous work highlights the intricate web of relationships and potential for conflict.\n\nThe scene escalates into a dramatic confrontation between Capulet and Paris, whose initial attraction for Rosaline quickly turns into a complex web of desire and intrigue.  Paris’s pleading and Romeo’s passionate declarations of love establish a significant emotional core of the play. Capulet refuses to reveal the terms of the proposed marriage and attempts to maintain a strategic distance, a stark contrast to Paris’s almost desperate pursuit.  The scene builds a palpable sense of impending drama, with hints of a collision of fate and the potential consequences of their actions.\n\n**Overall Mood and Literary Significance:**  The passage utilizes Shakespearean imagery - \"stars that make dark heaven light\" – to emphasize the significance of the feast and the heightened atmosphere of the moment. The language is richly layered, employing metaphors and allusions (e.g., “one more, most welcome, makes my number more”) to create a sense of grandeur and underlying tension. The dialogue is carefully constructed, revealing characters’ motivations, desires, and anxieties.  The emphasis on arranged marriage and social status suggests a play centered around ambition, rivalry, and the pursuit of a desirable outcome.  The contrast between Capulet's calculated approach and Paris's passionate yearning creates a central dynamic of desire and consequence.",

PARIS. Of honourable reckoning are you both, And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long. But now my lord, what say you to my suit? CAPULET. But saying o’er what I have said before. My child is yet a stranger in the world, She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. PARIS. Younger than she are happy mothers made. CAPULET. And too soon marr’d are those so early made. The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she, She is the hopeful lady of my earth: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part; And she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice. This night I hold an old accustom’d feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest, Such as I love, and you among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more. At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well apparell’d April on the heel Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be: Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, May stand in number, though in reckoning none. Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona; find those persons out Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say, My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._] SERVANT. Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! Enter Benvolio and Romeo. BENVOLIO. Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning, One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; One desperate grief cures with another’s languish: Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die. ROMEO. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. BENVOLIO. For what, I pray thee? ROMEO. For your broken shin. BENVOLIO. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? ROMEO. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is: Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow. SERVANT. God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? ROMEO. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. SERVANT. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you read anything you see? ROMEO. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. SERVANT. Ye say honestly, rest you merry! ROMEO. Stay, fellow; I can read. [_He reads the letter._] _Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; The lady widow of Utruvio; Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena. _ A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come? SERVANT. Up. ROMEO. Whither to supper? SERVANT. To our house. ROMEO. Whose house? SERVANT. My master’s. ROMEO. Indeed I should have ask’d you that before. SERVANT. Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry. [_Exit._] BENVOLIO. At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st; With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither and with unattainted eye, Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. ROMEO. When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire; And these who, often drown’d, could never die, Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars. One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun. BENVOLIO. Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself pois’d with herself in either eye: But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d Your lady’s love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best. ROMEO. I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [_Exeunt._]",

        "input_content": "***\n\nThe play opens in Capulet’s opulent house, with Lady Capulet and Nurse present. Juliet, a young woman, is summoned to the room, and the Nurse immediately begins to discuss Juliet’s impending marriage to Paris. The scene establishes a tense atmosphere, laden with foreshadowing and the weight of impending familial duty. Lady Capulet expresses her concern about Juliet’s well-being and the potential complications surrounding her marriage. The Nurse, a pragmatic and slightly melancholic figure, focuses on Juliet's age and the historical context of marriage – it's a matter of familial honor, and a seemingly insurmountable challenge to Juliet's future.\n\nThe Nurse’s conversation delves into the complexities of Juliet’s character, contrasting her youthful beauty with the expectations of Verona society. She emphasizes Juliet’s youth and the potential for a quick marriage, highlighting the pressure on her to fulfill a predetermined role. The Nurse’s anxieties, particularly regarding the “curse” of the library – a reference to the famous “curse of the apple” – suggest a superstitious element and an awareness of the potential negative consequences of marrying Paris.\n\nJuliet, in turn, expresses a sense of reluctance and a desire to avoid engagement, highlighting her desire for solitude and independence. The Nurse, however, pushes forward, emphasizing the historical significance of marriage – the “golden story” of Paris – and Juliet’s potential to be celebrated within Verona’s society. The Nurse skillfully crafts a persuasive argument regarding the value of marriage, using the imagery of a book – a metaphor for a carefully crafted narrative of love – and the “beauty’s pen” suggesting a meticulous and idealized examination of the potential match. She draws parallels between Juliet’s future and the historical story of Paris’ love, creating a deliberate juxtaposition of her present reality with a storied past.\n\nThe Nurse’s detailed observations of Paris – reading the volume of young Paris’ face – reveal a sophisticated and perhaps slightly obsessive interest in understanding the man. The Nurse’s words are laced with a subtle, almost theatrical, sense of observation and a hint of melancholy, framing the situation as a performance – a carefully orchestrated narrative. The Nurse’s final plea for Juliet to “seek happy nights to happy days” subtly underscores the emotional weight of her situation and her desire to avoid a life burdened by the potential of a marriage. The Servant’s arrival further underscores the sense of urgency and the impending storm of family drama.\n\nThe play is steeped in imagery – the \"wormwood\" symbolizes a threat or potential for bitterness – and it employs wordplay (\"By my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’\"), and subtly evokes a sense of impending doom through the mention of an earthquake and the looming presence of a long-ago “brain.”  The overall tone shifts from a cautionary narrative about marriage to a portrait of a young woman grappling with her destiny, driven by the forces of family expectations and the weight of a predetermined future. The language, while seemingly simple, carries an undeniable weight, reflecting the complex emotional landscape of the play.",

What, lamb! What ladybird! God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet! Enter Juliet. JULIET. How now, who calls? NURSE. Your mother. JULIET. Madam, I am here. What is your will? LADY CAPULET. This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again, I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel. Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age. NURSE. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. LADY CAPULET. She’s not fourteen. NURSE. I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth, And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four, She is not fourteen. How long is it now To Lammas-tide? LADY CAPULET. A fortnight and odd days. NURSE. Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!— Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me. But as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—, Of all the days of the year, upon that day: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua: Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug! Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge. And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before she broke her brow, And then my husband,—God be with his soul! A was a merry man,—took up the child: ‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’. To see now how a jest shall come about. I warrant, and I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’ LADY CAPULET. Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace. NURSE. Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’; And yet I warrant it had upon it brow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone; A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly. ‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’. JULIET. And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I. NURSE. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d: And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. LADY CAPULET. Marry, that marry is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married? JULIET. It is an honour that I dream not of. NURSE. An honour! Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat. LADY CAPULET. Well, think of marriage now: younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers. By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. NURSE. A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world—why he’s a man of wax. LADY CAPULET. Verona’s summer hath not such a flower. NURSE. Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower. LADY CAPULET. What say you, can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face, And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen. Examine every married lineament, And see how one another lends content; And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies, Find written in the margent of his eyes. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide. That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory, That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. NURSE. No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men. LADY CAPULET. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love? JULIET. I’ll look to like, if looking liking move: But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight. LADY CAPULET. We follow thee. [_Exit Servant._] Juliet, the County stays. NURSE. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. [_Exeunt._]",

        "input_content": "Here’s a detailed summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text's content, with modern prose and attention to key elements:\n\nThe play opens with Romeo, Mercutio, and Benvolio – a group of masked characters – entering a bustling street. They are ostensibly seeking an excuse to continue a clandestine meeting, but the atmosphere is charged with a sense of impending trouble. Romeo, feeling pressured, expresses his reluctance, while Mercutio, ever the playful catalyst, pushes for action.  The scene establishes a dramatic atmosphere of anticipation and a subtle undercurrent of a larger, potentially perilous plot.\n\nThe core conflict revolves around Romeo’s longing for a passionate romance. He’s consumed by a desire to experience love, but he’s weighed down by the potential for heartbreak.  He’s attempting to subtly sabotage his own involvement in a potentially disastrous situation – a match with Juliet, a young woman he desperately desires.  Mercutio, acting as a foil, is focused on the potential downsides of romantic pursuit, highlighting the risks and complications involved.  The mention of Cupid and a \"tartar's painted bow\" sets a whimsical but ominous tone, suggesting a potentially fraught encounter.\n\nThe characters’ conversation progresses through a series of witty exchanges. Romeo is increasingly melancholic and resigned to his fate, contemplating the difficulty of achieving his desires.  Mercutio, predictably, seeks to entertain the audience with his rapid-fire, almost nonsensical, commentary.  The dialogue is filled with puns, wordplay, and a slightly frantic energy – mirroring Romeo’s internal turmoil.  The “mask” is a key symbolic element, representing the hiding of true feelings and the difficulty of confronting one's desires. \n\nThe passage progresses with a somewhat surreal and theatrical sequence of events. Romeo dreams of a vision – a nightmarish dreamscape – featuring a regal figure (Queen Mab) with fantastical appearance. This dream serves as a catalyst for his obsessive thoughts and anxieties. It establishes the scene’s bizarre, almost fairy-tale, setting.  The inclusion of insects – beetles, spiders, and other crawling creatures – amplifies the sense of unease and the bizarre, otherworldly nature of the dream. The imagery of the “wagon-spokes,” “lashes,” and “whistle” further reinforces this unsettling aesthetic. \n\nThe eventual decision to “burn daylight” underscores the characters’ desire to escape a situation that feels increasingly fraught.  The phrase \"a candle-holder and look on\" hints at a significant and perhaps tragic event to come. The mention of \"courtiers' knees,\" \"lawyers' fingers,\" and “ladies' lips” further underscores the scope and gravity of what’s about to unfold. \n\nThe final exchange is a masterful display of dramatic tension – a rapid volley of insults and attempts to throw the characters off balance. The scene culminates with a palpable sense of impending doom, establishing the setup for the tragic events to follow. The opening lines – \"Peace, peace, Romeo, peace, Thou talk’st of nothing\" – signify the beginning of a significant crisis and the weight of the characters' predicament.\n\nIn essence, the passage uses a blend of witty dialogue, surreal imagery, and symbolic motifs to create a sense of impending drama and a deeply uncomfortable situation. It’s a carefully crafted setup that leaves the audience wondering what consequences will arise from Romeo’s impulsive actions.",

Or shall we on without apology? BENVOLIO. The date is out of such prolixity: We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath, Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke After the prompter, for our entrance: But let them measure us by what they will, We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone. ROMEO. Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling; Being but heavy I will bear the light. MERCUTIO. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. ROMEO. Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes, With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. MERCUTIO. You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings, And soar with them above a common bound. ROMEO. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. Under love’s heavy burden do I sink. MERCUTIO. And, to sink in it, should you burden love; Too great oppression for a tender thing. ROMEO. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn. MERCUTIO. If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._] A visor for a visor. What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities? Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me. BENVOLIO. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs. ROMEO. A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart, Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase, I’ll be a candle-holder and look on, The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done. MERCUTIO. Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word: If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho. ROMEO. Nay, that’s not so. MERCUTIO. I mean sir, in delay We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day. Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits. ROMEO. And we mean well in going to this mask; But ’tis no wit to go. MERCUTIO. Why, may one ask? ROMEO. I dreamt a dream tonight. MERCUTIO. And so did I. ROMEO. Well what was yours? MERCUTIO. That dreamers often lie. ROMEO. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. MERCUTIO. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men’s noses as they lie asleep: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs; The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web; The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams; Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film; Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid: Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love; O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight; O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees; O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail, Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice: Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night; And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes: This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them, and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she,— ROMEO. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace, Thou talk’st of nothing. MERCUTIO. True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air, And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence, Turning his side to the dew-dropping south. BENVOLIO. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves: Supper is done, and we shall come too late. ROMEO. I fear too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars, Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night’s revels; and expire the term Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But he that hath the steerage of my course Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen! BENVOLIO. Strike, drum. [_Exeunt._]",

        "input_content": "Okay, here’s a modern summary of the passage, aiming for approximately 60-70% of the original text’s content, maintaining the emotional tone, thematic elements, and literary significance, and incorporating specific details:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe play opens with musicians performing in Capulet’s house, and the Capulet guests and ladies milling about.  The scene establishes a heightened atmosphere of anticipation and veiled tension.  Initially, the focus is on the rivalry between Antony (Romeo’s cousin) and Potpan, a young servant who’s preoccupied with polishing and scraping.  The second servant, a more observant one, expresses concern about the state of the court’s etiquette and the mounting tension surrounding the upcoming wedding of Lucentio, a wealthy nobleman.  The narrative quickly shifts to Romeo and Antony’s burgeoning romance, with Antony acting as a key figure in their burgeoning connection. The scene is punctuated by the enthusiastic music, which suggests a heightened sense of excitement and a burgeoning attraction. \n\nThe atmosphere becomes increasingly charged as Romeo and Antony engage in a lively conversation, hinting at a complex relationship and possibly a political connection. The Nurse, a trusted confidante to Juliet, observes the scene with a keen eye, and is subtly critical of the behavior of the Capulet family.  The Nurse, in particular, is pragmatic about the situation, recognizing the potential for drama and misunderstanding. \n\nA key moment arrives when Romeo and Antony are joined by the second servant, who nervously offers to cover the scene with a mask, signifying a shift from polite social conduct to a more clandestine and potentially turbulent affair. \n\nThe scene culminates with Romeo and Juliet's first meeting, which is framed as an almost comical, albeit unsettling, encounter. The Nurse's description of the scene – “Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!” – underscores the underlying significance of their connection, subtly hinting at a passionate and perhaps forbidden romance. The scene builds a sense of impending importance as the Capulet family, particularly the Capulet’s cousin Tybalt, arrives, setting a stage for a potential conflict. Tybalt’s presence underscores the stakes of the play. \n\nThe play is marked by a sense of foreboding and uncertainty as the characters are ushered into the maskers – a group of influential figures. The scene becomes a turning point, subtly raising the possibility of a dramatic collision and a significant shift in the narrative’s trajectory, culminating in a moment of clandestine recognition and a shared moment of intense emotion.",

Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan! SECOND SERVANT. Ay, boy, ready. FIRST SERVANT. You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber. SECOND SERVANT. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. [_Exeunt._] Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers. CAPULET. Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you. Ah my mistresses, which of you all Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now? Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day That I have worn a visor, and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear, Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone, You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls. [_Music plays, and they dance._] More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well. Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet, For you and I are past our dancing days; How long is’t now since last yourself and I Were in a mask? CAPULET’S COUSIN. By’r Lady, thirty years. CAPULET. What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much: ’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d. CAPULET’S COUSIN. ’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir; His son is thirty. CAPULET. Will you tell me that? His son was but a ward two years ago. ROMEO. What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight? SERVANT. I know not, sir. ROMEO. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear; Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows. The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand, And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night. TYBALT. This by his voice, should be a Montague. Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave Come hither, cover’d with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. CAPULET. Why how now, kinsman! Wherefore storm you so? TYBALT. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night. CAPULET. Young Romeo, is it? TYBALT. ’Tis he, that villain Romeo. CAPULET. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone, A bears him like a portly gentleman; And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth. I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient, take no note of him, It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. TYBALT. It fits when such a villain is a guest: I’ll not endure him. CAPULET. He shall be endur’d. What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to; Am I the master here, or you? Go to. You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul, You’ll make a mutiny among my guests! You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man! TYBALT. Why, uncle, ’tis a shame. CAPULET. Go to, go to! You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed? This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what. You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time. Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go: Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame! I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts. TYBALT. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall. [_Exit._] ROMEO. [_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this, My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. JULIET. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss. ROMEO. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? JULIET. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. ROMEO. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do: They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. JULIET. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake. ROMEO. Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d. [_Kissing her._] JULIET. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. ROMEO. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d! Give me my sin again. JULIET. You kiss by the book. NURSE. Madam, your mother craves a word with you. ROMEO. What is her mother? NURSE. Marry, bachelor, Her mother is the lady of the house, And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous. I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal. I tell you, he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks. ROMEO. Is she a Capulet? O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt. BENVOLIO. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. ROMEO. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. CAPULET. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone, We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all; I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed. Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late, I’ll to my rest. [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._] JULIET. Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman? NURSE. The son and heir of old Tiberio. JULIET. What’s he that now is going out of door? NURSE. Marry, that I think be young Petruchio. JULIET. What’s he that follows here, that would not dance? NURSE. I know not. JULIET. Go ask his name. If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed. NURSE. His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy. JULIET. My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, That I must love a loathed enemy. NURSE. What’s this? What’s this? JULIET. A rhyme I learn’d even now Of one I danc’d withal. [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._] NURSE. Anon, anon! Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone. [_Exeunt._]",

My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. You say you do not know the lady’s mind. Uneven is the course; I like it not. PARIS. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death, And therefore have I little talk’d of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage, To stop the inundation of her tears, Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. [_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.— Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. Enter Juliet. PARIS. Happily met, my lady and my wife! JULIET. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. PARIS. That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next. JULIET. What must be shall be. FRIAR LAWRENCE. That’s a certain text. PARIS. Come you to make confession to this father? JULIET. To answer that, I should confess to you. PARIS. Do not deny to him that you love me. JULIET. I will confess to you that I love him. PARIS. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. JULIET. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back than to your face. PARIS. Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears. JULIET. The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite. PARIS. Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report. JULIET. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face. PARIS. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it. JULIET. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Are you at leisure, holy father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass? FRIAR LAWRENCE. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone. PARIS. God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye, Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. [_Exit._] JULIET. O shut the door, and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help! FRIAR LAWRENCE. O Juliet, I already know thy grief; It strains me past the compass of my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County. JULIET. Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently. God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time, Give me some present counsel, or behold ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring. Be not so long to speak. I long to die, If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop’st with death himself to scape from it. And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy. JULIET. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower, Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears; Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house, O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls. Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble, And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow; Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest, The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall, Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part depriv’d of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it. JULIET. Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear! FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. JULIET. Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear father. [_Exeunt._]",

Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground; So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear’st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. PAGE. [_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [_Retires._] PARIS. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones, Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans. The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. [_The Page whistles._] The boy gives warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way tonight, To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite? What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile. [_Retires._] Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c. ROMEO. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father. Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady’s face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. BALTHASAR. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. ROMEO. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow. BALTHASAR. For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout. His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [_Retires_] ROMEO. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, [_Breaking open the door of the monument._] And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food. PARIS. This is that banish’d haughty Montague That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,— And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. [_Advances._] Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague. Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. Obey, and go with me, for thou must die. ROMEO. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man. Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury. O be gone. By heaven I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm’d against myself. Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say, A madman’s mercy bid thee run away. PARIS. I do defy thy conjuration, And apprehend thee for a felon here. ROMEO. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy! [_They fight._] PAGE. O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. [_Exit._] PARIS. O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [_Dies._] ROMEO. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris! What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book. I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d. [_Laying Paris in the monument._] How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! Which their keepers call A lightning before death. O, how may I Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife, Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death’s pale flag is not advanced there. Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again. Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest; And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide. Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark. Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. [_Dies._] Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a lantern, crow, and spade. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there? Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead? BALTHASAR. Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, It burneth in the Capels’ monument. BALTHASAR. It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master, One that you love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who is it? BALTHASAR. Romeo. FRIAR LAWRENCE. How long hath he been there? BALTHASAR. Full half an hour. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Go with me to the vault. BALTHASAR. I dare not, sir; My master knows not but I am gone hence, And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. BALTHASAR. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Romeo! [_Advances._] Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour’d by this place of peace? [_Enters the monument._] Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance? The lady stirs. [_Juliet wakes and stirs._] JULIET. O comfortable Friar, where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo? [_Noise within._] FRIAR LAWRENCE. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. JULIET. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. [_Exit Friar Lawrence._] What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative. [_Kisses him._] Thy lips are warm! FIRST WATCH. [_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way? JULIET. Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger. [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._] This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die. [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._] Enter Watch with the Page of Paris. PAGE. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. FIRST WATCH. The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach. [_Exeunt some of the Watch._] Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues, some others search. [_Exeunt others of the Watch._] We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar. SECOND WATCH. Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard. FIRST WATCH. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence. THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side. FIRST WATCH. A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too. Enter the Prince and Attendants. PRINCE. What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning’s rest? Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others. CAPULET. What should it be that they so shriek abroad? LADY CAPULET. O the people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run With open outcry toward our monument. PRINCE. What fear is this which startles in our ears? FIRST WATCH. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill’d. PRINCE. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. FIRST WATCH. Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs. CAPULET. O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom. LADY CAPULET. O me! This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre. Enter Montague and others. PRINCE. Come, Montague, for thou art early up, To see thy son and heir more early down. MONTAGUE. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age? PRINCE. Look, and thou shalt see. MONTAGUE. O thou untaught! What manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave? PRINCE. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience. Bring forth the parties of suspicion. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus’d. PRINCE. Then say at once what thou dost know in this. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; and their stol’n marriage day Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow’d grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight Return’d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law. PRINCE. We still have known thee for a holy man. Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this? BALTHASAR. I brought my master news of Juliet’s death, And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not, and left him there. PRINCE. Give me the letter, I will look on it. Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place? PAGE. He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch. PRINCE. This letter doth make good the Friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d. CAPULET. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand. MONTAGUE. But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. CAPULET. As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity. PRINCE. A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",

O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over lowering hills: Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love, And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come. Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She’d be as swift in motion as a ball; My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me. But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. Enter Nurse and Peter. O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news? Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. NURSE. Peter, stay at the gate. [_Exit Peter._] JULIET. Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad? Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face. NURSE. I am aweary, give me leave awhile; Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had! JULIET. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak. NURSE. Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am out of breath? JULIET. How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that; Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance. Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad? NURSE. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home? JULIET. No, no. But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? What of that? NURSE. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I! It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back! Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jauncing up and down. JULIET. I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love? NURSE. Your love says like an honest gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother? JULIET. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest. ‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman, ‘Where is your mother?’ NURSE. O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow. Is this the poultice for my aching bones? Henceforward do your messages yourself. JULIET. Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo? NURSE. Have you got leave to go to shrift today? JULIET. I have. NURSE. Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife. Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news. Hie you to church. I must another way, To fetch a ladder by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark. I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; But you shall bear the burden soon at night. Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell. JULIET. Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell. [_Exeunt._]",

SAMPSON. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. GREGORY. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away. SAMPSON. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s. GREGORY. That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall. SAMPSON. True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. GREGORY. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. SAMPSON. ’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads. GREGORY. The heads of the maids? SAMPSON. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt. GREGORY. They must take it in sense that feel it. SAMPSON.

Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues. Enter Abram and Balthasar. SAMPSON. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. GREGORY. How? Turn thy back and run? SAMPSON. Fear me not. GREGORY. No, marry; I fear thee! SAMPSON. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. GREGORY. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. SAMPSON. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it. ABRAM. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON. I do bite my thumb, sir. ABRAM. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON. Is the law of our side if I say ay? GREGORY. No. SAMPSON. No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir. GREGORY. Do you quarrel, sir? ABRAM. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. SAMPSON.

I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me. TYBALT. What, drawn, and talk of peace?

Why call you for a sword? CAPULET. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Enter Montague and his Lady Montague. MONTAGUE. Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go. LADY MONTAGUE. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants. PRINCE. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,— Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground And hear the sentence of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets, And made Verona’s ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate. If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time all the rest depart away: You, Capulet, shall go along with me, And Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our farther pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgement-place. Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt, Citizens and Servants._] MONTAGUE. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? BENVOLIO. Here were the servants of your adversary And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. I drew to part them, in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d, Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears, He swung about his head, and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part. LADY MONTAGUE. O where is Romeo, saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. BENVOLIO. Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun Peer’d forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad, Where underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me. MONTAGUE. Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove. BENVOLIO. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? MONTAGUE. I neither know it nor can learn of him. BENVOLIO. Have you importun’d him by any means? MONTAGUE. Both by myself and many other friends; But he, his own affections’ counsellor, Is to himself—I will not say how true— But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter Romeo. BENVOLIO. See, where he comes. So please you step aside; I’ll know his grievance or be much denied. MONTAGUE. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away, [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._] BENVOLIO. Good morrow, cousin. ROMEO. Is the day so young? BENVOLIO. But new struck nine. ROMEO. Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast? BENVOLIO. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours? ROMEO. Not having that which, having, makes them short. BENVOLIO. In love? ROMEO. Out. BENVOLIO. Of love? ROMEO. Out of her favour where I am in love. BENVOLIO. Alas that love so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. ROMEO. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? BENVOLIO. No coz, I rather weep. ROMEO. Good heart, at what? BENVOLIO. At thy good heart’s oppression. ROMEO. Why such is love’s transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears: What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Farewell, my coz. [_Going._] BENVOLIO. Soft! I will go along: And if you leave me so, you do me wrong. ROMEO. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here. This is not Romeo, he’s some other where. BENVOLIO. Tell me in sadness who is that you love? ROMEO. What, shall I groan and tell thee? BENVOLIO. Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who. ROMEO. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will, A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill. In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. BENVOLIO. I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d. ROMEO. A right good markman, and she’s fair I love. BENVOLIO. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. ROMEO. Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit; And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d, From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d. She will not stay the siege of loving terms Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: O she’s rich in beauty, only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store. BENVOLIO. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? ROMEO. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; For beauty starv’d with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead, that live to tell it now. BENVOLIO. Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her. ROMEO. O teach me how I should forget to think. BENVOLIO. By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. ROMEO. ’Tis the way To call hers, exquisite, in question more. These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair; He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair? Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget. BENVOLIO. I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. [_Exeunt._]",

Capulet is anxious about securing a favorable alliance, vital for his family’s position, while Paris, acutely aware of the occasion’s significance, seeks a strategic match. The Servant’s task highlights the intricate network of social connections – prominent Verona figures like the shoemaker, tailor, and fisherman – all linked to the wealthy Capulet lineage.  Paris, captivated by the beautiful Rosaline, pursues a passionate, idealized love, contrasting sharply with Capulet’s calculated desire for a marriage alliance. \n\nCapulet refuses to reveal the terms of the proposed marriage and attempts to maintain distance, creating a dramatic tension.  Romeo, drawn to Rosaline, expresses passionate love, escalating the conflict between Capulet and Paris. The scene showcases the play’s focus on arranged marriage, social ambition, and the consequences of their choices, culminating in a collision of desire and impending drama.\n\n**Overall Mood and Literary Significance:** The passage employs Shakespearean imagery—“stars that make dark heaven light”—to portray the feast and heighten the tension. The language is rich with metaphors and allusions, creating a grand, dramatic atmosphere. The dialogue reveals characters' motivations and anxieties, particularly Capulet's calculated maneuvering versus Paris’s passionate yearning. The core of the play is a desperate attempt to secure a desirable outcome amidst societal pressures and familial obligations.",

The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she, She is the hopeful lady of my earth: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part; And she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice. This night I hold an old accustom’d feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest, Such as I love, and you among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more. At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well apparell’d April on the heel Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be: Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, May stand in number, though in reckoning none. Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona; find those persons out Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say, My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._] SERVANT. Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! Enter Benvolio and Romeo. BENVOLIO. Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning, One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; One desperate grief cures with another’s languish: Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die. ROMEO. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. BENVOLIO. For what, I pray thee? ROMEO. For your broken shin. BENVOLIO. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? ROMEO. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is: Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow. SERVANT. God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? ROMEO. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. SERVANT. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you read anything you see? ROMEO. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. SERVANT. Ye say honestly, rest you merry! ROMEO. Stay, fellow; I can read. [_He reads the letter._] _Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; The lady widow of Utruvio; Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena. _ A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come? SERVANT. Up. ROMEO. Whither to supper? SERVANT. To our house. ROMEO. Whose house? SERVANT. My master’s. ROMEO. Indeed I should have ask’d you that before. SERVANT. Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry. [_Exit._] BENVOLIO. At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st; With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither and with unattainted eye, Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. ROMEO. When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire; And these who, often drown’d, could never die, Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars. One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun. BENVOLIO. Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself pois’d with herself in either eye: But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d Your lady’s love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best. ROMEO. I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [_Exeunt._]",

What, lamb! What ladybird! God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet! Enter Juliet. JULIET. How now, who calls? NURSE. Your mother. JULIET. Madam, I am here. What is your will? LADY CAPULET. This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again, I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel. Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age. NURSE. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. LADY CAPULET. She’s not fourteen. NURSE. I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth, And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four, She is not fourteen. How long is it now To Lammas-tide? LADY CAPULET. A fortnight and odd days. NURSE. Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!— Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me. But as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—, Of all the days of the year, upon that day: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua: Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug! Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge. And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before she broke her brow, And then my husband,—God be with his soul! A was a merry man,—took up the child: ‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’. To see now how a jest shall come about. I warrant, and I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’ LADY CAPULET. Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace. NURSE. Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’; And yet I warrant it had upon it brow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone; A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly. ‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’. JULIET. And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I. NURSE. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d: And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. LADY CAPULET. Marry, that marry is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married? JULIET. It is an honour that I dream not of. NURSE. An honour! Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat. LADY CAPULET. Well, think of marriage now: younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers. By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. NURSE. A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world—why he’s a man of wax. LADY CAPULET. Verona’s summer hath not such a flower. NURSE. Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower. LADY CAPULET. What say you, can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face, And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen. Examine every married lineament, And see how one another lends content; And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies, Find written in the margent of his eyes. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide. That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory, That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. NURSE. No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men. LADY CAPULET. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love? JULIET. I’ll look to like, if looking liking move: But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight. LADY CAPULET. We follow thee. [_Exit Servant._] Juliet, the County stays. NURSE. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. [_Exeunt._]",

The date is out of such prolixity: We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath, Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke After the prompter, for our entrance: But let them measure us by what they will, We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone. ROMEO. Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling; Being but heavy I will bear the light. MERCUTIO. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. ROMEO. Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes, With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. MERCUTIO. You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings, And soar with them above a common bound. ROMEO. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. Under love’s heavy burden do I sink. MERCUTIO. And, to sink in it, should you burden love; Too great oppression for a tender thing. ROMEO. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn. MERCUTIO. If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._] A visor for a visor. What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities? Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me. BENVOLIO. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs. ROMEO. A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart, Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase, I’ll be a candle-holder and look on, The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done. MERCUTIO. Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word: If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho. ROMEO. Nay, that’s not so. MERCUTIO. I mean sir, in delay We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day. Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits. ROMEO. And we mean well in going to this mask; But ’tis no wit to go. MERCUTIO. Why, may one ask? ROMEO. I dreamt a dream tonight. MERCUTIO. And so did I. ROMEO. Well what was yours? MERCUTIO. That dreamers often lie. ROMEO. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. MERCUTIO. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men’s noses as they lie asleep: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs; The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web; The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams; Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film; Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid: Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love; O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight; O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees; O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail, Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice: Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night; And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes: This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them, and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she,— ROMEO. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace, Thou talk’st of nothing. MERCUTIO. True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air, And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence, Turning his side to the dew-dropping south. BENVOLIO. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves: Supper is done, and we shall come too late. ROMEO. I fear too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars, Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night’s revels; and expire the term Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But he that hath the steerage of my course Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen! BENVOLIO. Strike, drum. [_Exeunt._]",

When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing. FIRST SERVANT. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan! SECOND SERVANT. Ay, boy, ready. FIRST SERVANT. You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber. SECOND SERVANT. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. [_Exeunt._] Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers. CAPULET. Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you. Ah my mistresses, which of you all Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now? Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day That I have worn a visor, and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear, Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone, You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls. [_Music plays, and they dance._] More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well. Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet, For you and I are past our dancing days; How long is’t now since last yourself and I Were in a mask? CAPULET’S COUSIN. By’r Lady, thirty years. CAPULET. What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much: ’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d. CAPULET’S COUSIN. ’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir; His son is thirty. CAPULET. Will you tell me that? His son was but a ward two years ago. ROMEO. What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight? SERVANT. I know not, sir. ROMEO. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear; Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows. The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand, And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night. TYBALT. This by his voice, should be a Montague. Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave Come hither, cover’d with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. CAPULET. Why how now, kinsman! Wherefore storm you so? TYBALT. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night. CAPULET. Young Romeo, is it? TYBALT. ’Tis he, that villain Romeo. CAPULET. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone, A bears him like a portly gentleman; And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth. I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient, take no note of him, It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. TYBALT. It fits when such a villain is a guest: I’ll not endure him. CAPULET. He shall be endur’d. What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to; Am I the master here, or you? Go to. You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul, You’ll make a mutiny among my guests! You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man! TYBALT. Why, uncle, ’tis a shame. CAPULET. Go to, go to! You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed? This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what. You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time. Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go: Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame! I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts. TYBALT. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall. [_Exit._] ROMEO. [_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this, My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. JULIET. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss. ROMEO. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? JULIET. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. ROMEO. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do: They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. JULIET. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake. ROMEO. Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d. [_Kissing her._] JULIET. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. ROMEO. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d! Give me my sin again. JULIET. You kiss by the book. NURSE. Madam, your mother craves a word with you. ROMEO. What is her mother? NURSE. Marry, bachelor, Her mother is the lady of the house, And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous. I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal. I tell you, he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks. ROMEO. Is she a Capulet? O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt. BENVOLIO. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. ROMEO. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. CAPULET. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone, We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all; I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed. Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late, I’ll to my rest. [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._] JULIET. Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman? NURSE. The son and heir of old Tiberio. JULIET. What’s he that now is going out of door? NURSE. Marry, that I think be young Petruchio. JULIET. What’s he that follows here, that would not dance? NURSE. I know not. JULIET. Go ask his name. If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed. NURSE. His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy. JULIET. My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, That I must love a loathed enemy. NURSE. What’s this? What’s this? JULIET. A rhyme I learn’d even now Of one I danc’d withal. [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._] NURSE. Anon, anon! Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone. [_Exeunt._]",
