    "content": "Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris. FRIAR LAWRENCE. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short. PARIS. My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. You say you do not know the lady\u2019s mind. Uneven is the course; I like it not. PARIS. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\u2019s death, And therefore have I little talk\u2019d of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage, To stop the inundation of her tears, Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. [_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow\u2019d.\u2014 Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. Enter Juliet. PARIS. Happily met, my lady and my wife! JULIET. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. PARIS. That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next. JULIET. What must be shall be. FRIAR LAWRENCE. That\u2019s a certain text. PARIS. Come you to make confession to this father? JULIET. To answer that, I should confess to you. PARIS. Do not deny to him that you love me. JULIET. I will confess to you that I love him. PARIS. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. JULIET. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back than to your face. PARIS. Poor soul, thy face is much abus\u2019d with tears. JULIET. The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite. PARIS. Thou wrong\u2019st it more than tears with that report. JULIET. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face. PARIS. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander\u2019d it. JULIET. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Are you at leisure, holy father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass? FRIAR LAWRENCE. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\u2014 My lord, we must entreat the time alone. PARIS. God shield I should disturb devotion!\u2014 Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye, Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. [_Exit._] JULIET. O shut the door, and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help! FRIAR LAWRENCE. O Juliet, I already know thy grief; It strains me past the compass of my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County. JULIET. Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear\u2019st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I\u2019ll help it presently. God join\u2019d my heart and Romeo\u2019s, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo\u2019s seal\u2019d, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc\u2019d time, Give me some present counsel, or behold \u2019Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring. Be not so long to speak. I long to die, If what thou speak\u2019st speak not of remedy. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop\u2019st with death himself to scape from it. And if thou dar\u2019st, I\u2019ll give thee remedy. JULIET. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower, Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears; Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house, O\u2019er-cover\u2019d quite with dead men\u2019s rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls. Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble, And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstain\u2019d wife to my sweet love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow; Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest, The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes\u2019 windows fall, Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part depriv\u2019d of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. And in this borrow\u2019d likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes, uncover\u2019d, on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it. JULIET. Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear! FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I\u2019ll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. JULIET. Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear father. [_Exeunt._]",

What says Romeo? Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. FRIAR JOHN. Going to find a barefoot brother out, One of our order, to associate me, Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Seal\u2019d up the doors, and would not let us forth, So that my speed to Mantua there was stay\u2019d. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who bare my letter then to Romeo? FRIAR JOHN. I could not send it,\u2014here it is again,\u2014 Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood, The letter was not nice, but full of charge, Of dear import, and the neglecting it May do much danger. Friar John, go hence, Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell. FRIAR JOHN. Brother, I\u2019ll go and bring it thee. [_Exit._] FRIAR LAWRENCE. Now must I to the monument alone. Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake. She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents; But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come. Poor living corse, clos\u2019d in a dead man\u2019s tomb. [_Exit._]",

    "content": "Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch. PARIS. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof. Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground; So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear\u2019st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. PAGE. [_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [_Retires._] PARIS. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones, Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Or wanting that, with tears distill\u2019d by moans. The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. [_The Page whistles._] The boy gives warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way tonight, To cross my obsequies and true love\u2019s rite? What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile. [_Retires._] Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c. ROMEO. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father. Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate\u2019er thou hear\u2019st or seest, stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady\u2019s face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. BALTHASAR. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. ROMEO. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow. BALTHASAR. For all this same, I\u2019ll hide me hereabout. His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [_Retires_] ROMEO. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg\u2019d with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, [_Breaking open the door of the monument._] And in despite, I\u2019ll cram thee with more food. PARIS. This is that banish\u2019d haughty Montague That murder\u2019d my love\u2019s cousin,\u2014with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,\u2014 And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. [_Advances._] Stop thy unhallow\u2019d toil, vile Montague. Can vengeance be pursu\u2019d further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. Obey, and go with me, for thou must die. ROMEO. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man. Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury. O be gone. By heaven I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm\u2019d against myself. Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say, A madman\u2019s mercy bid thee run away. PARIS. I do defy thy conjuration, And apprehend thee for a felon here. ROMEO. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy! [_They fight._] PAGE. O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. [_Exit._] PARIS. O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [_Dies._] ROMEO. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. Mercutio\u2019s kinsman, noble County Paris! What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune\u2019s book. I\u2019ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught\u2019red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr\u2019d. [_Laying Paris in the monument._] How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! Which their keepers call A lightning before death. O, how may I Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife, Death that hath suck\u2019d the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquer\u2019d. Beauty\u2019s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death\u2019s pale flag is not advanced there. Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again. Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest; And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide. Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark. Here\u2019s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. [_Dies._] Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a lantern, crow, and spade. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who\u2019s there? Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead? BALTHASAR. Here\u2019s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, It burneth in the Capels\u2019 monument. BALTHASAR. It doth so, holy sir, and there\u2019s my master, One that you love. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who is it? BALTHASAR. Romeo. FRIAR LAWRENCE. How long hath he been there? BALTHASAR. Full half an hour. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Go with me to the vault. BALTHASAR. I dare not, sir; My master knows not but I am gone hence, And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Stay then, I\u2019ll go alone. Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. BALTHASAR. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Romeo! [_Advances._] Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour\u2019d by this place of peace? [_Enters the monument._] Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? And steep\u2019d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance? The lady stirs. [_Juliet wakes and stirs._] JULIET. O comfortable Friar, where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo? [_Noise within._] FRIAR LAWRENCE. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too. Come, I\u2019ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. JULIET. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. [_Exit Friar Lawrence._] What\u2019s here? A cup clos\u2019d in my true love\u2019s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative. [_Kisses him._] Thy lips are warm! FIRST WATCH. [_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way? JULIET. Yea, noise? Then I\u2019ll be brief. O happy dagger. [_Snatching Romeo\u2019s dagger._] This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die. [_Falls on Romeo\u2019s body and dies._] Enter Watch with the Page of Paris. PAGE. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. FIRST WATCH. The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you, whoe\u2019er you find attach. [_Exeunt some of the Watch._] Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues, some others search. [_Exeunt others of the Watch._] We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar. SECOND WATCH. Here\u2019s Romeo\u2019s man. We found him in the churchyard. FIRST WATCH. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence. THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side. FIRST WATCH. A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too. Enter the Prince and Attendants. PRINCE. What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning\u2019s rest? Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others. CAPULET. What should it be that they so shriek abroad? LADY CAPULET. O the people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run With open outcry toward our monument. PRINCE. What fear is this which startles in our ears? FIRST WATCH. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill\u2019d. PRINCE. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. FIRST WATCH. Here is a Friar, and slaughter\u2019d Romeo\u2019s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men\u2019s tombs. CAPULET. O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista\u2019en, for lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter\u2019s bosom. LADY CAPULET. O me! This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre. Enter Montague and others. PRINCE. Come, Montague, for thou art early up, To see thy son and heir more early down. MONTAGUE. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. Grief of my son\u2019s exile hath stopp\u2019d her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age? PRINCE. Look, and thou shalt see. MONTAGUE. O thou untaught! What manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave? PRINCE. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience. Bring forth the parties of suspicion. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus\u2019d. PRINCE. Then say at once what thou dost know in this. FRIAR LAWRENCE. I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead, that Romeo\u2019s faithful wife. I married them; and their stol\u2019n marriage day Was Tybalt\u2019s doomsday, whose untimely death Banish\u2019d the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\u2019d. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth\u2019d, and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow\u2019d grave, Being the time the potion\u2019s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay\u2019d by accident; and yesternight Return\u2019d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred\u2019s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrific\u2019d, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law. PRINCE. We still have known thee for a holy man. Where\u2019s Romeo\u2019s man? What can he say to this? BALTHASAR. I brought my master news of Juliet\u2019s death, And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threaten\u2019d me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not, and left him there. PRINCE. Give me the letter, I will look on it. Where is the County\u2019s Page that rais\u2019d the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place? PAGE. He came with flowers to strew his lady\u2019s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch. PRINCE. This letter doth make good the Friar\u2019s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor \u2019pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish\u2019d. CAPULET. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter\u2019s jointure, for no more Can I demand. MONTAGUE. But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. CAPULET. As rich shall Romeo\u2019s by his lady\u2019s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity. PRINCE. A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon\u2019d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",

My bosom\u2019s lord sits lightly in his throne; And all this day an unaccustom\u2019d spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,\u2014 Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!\u2014 And breath\u2019d such life with kisses in my lips, That I reviv\u2019d, and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess\u2019d, When but love\u2019s shadows are so rich in joy. Enter Balthasar. News from Verona! How now, Balthasar? Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How fares my Juliet? That I ask again; For nothing can be ill if she be well. BALTHASAR. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capel\u2019s monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred\u2019s vault, And presently took post to tell it you. O pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir. ROMEO. Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars! Thou know\u2019st my lodging. Get me ink and paper, And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight. BALTHASAR. I do beseech you sir, have patience. Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure. ROMEO. Tush, thou art deceiv\u2019d. Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar? BALTHASAR. No, my good lord. ROMEO. No matter. Get thee gone, And hire those horses. I\u2019ll be with thee straight. [_Exit Balthasar._] Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. Let\u2019s see for means. O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men. I do remember an apothecary,\u2014 And hereabouts he dwells,\u2014which late I noted In tatter\u2019d weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples, meagre were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuff\u2019d, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses Were thinly scatter\u2019d, to make up a show. Noting this penury, to myself I said, And if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. O, this same thought did but forerun my need, And this same needy man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house. Being holiday, the beggar\u2019s shop is shut. What, ho! Apothecary! Enter Apothecary. APOTHECARY. Who calls so loud? ROMEO. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins, That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg\u2019d of breath As violently as hasty powder fir\u2019d Doth hurry from the fatal cannon\u2019s womb. APOTHECARY. Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua\u2019s law Is death to any he that utters them. ROMEO. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear\u2019st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back. The world is not thy friend, nor the world\u2019s law; The world affords no law to make thee rich; Then be not poor, but break it and take this. APOTHECARY. My poverty, but not my will consents. ROMEO. I pay thy poverty, and not thy will. APOTHECARY. Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off; and, if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight. ROMEO. There is thy gold, worse poison to men\u2019s souls, Doing more murder in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none. Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh. Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet\u2019s grave, for there must I use thee. [_Exeunt._]",

How sound is she asleep! I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam! Ay, let the County take you in your bed, He\u2019ll fright you up, i\u2019faith. Will it not be? What, dress\u2019d, and in your clothes, and down again? I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady! Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady\u2019s dead! O, well-a-day that ever I was born. Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady! Enter Lady Capulet. LADY CAPULET. What noise is here? NURSE. O lamentable day! LADY CAPULET. What is the matter? NURSE. Look, look! O heavy day! LADY CAPULET. O me, O me! My child, my only life. Revive, look up, or I will die with thee. Help, help! Call help. Enter Capulet. CAPULET. For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come. NURSE. She\u2019s dead, deceas\u2019d, she\u2019s dead; alack the day! LADY CAPULET. Alack the day, she\u2019s dead, she\u2019s dead, she\u2019s dead! CAPULET. Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She\u2019s cold, Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff. Life and these lips have long been separated. Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. NURSE. O lamentable day! LADY CAPULET. O woful time! CAPULET. Death, that hath ta\u2019en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Come, is the bride ready to go to church? CAPULET. Ready to go, but never to return. O son, the night before thy wedding day Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies, Flower as she was, deflowered by him. Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir; My daughter he hath wedded. I will die And leave him all; life, living, all is death\u2019s. PARIS. Have I thought long to see this morning\u2019s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this? LADY CAPULET. Accurs\u2019d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day. Most miserable hour that e\u2019er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage. But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catch\u2019d it from my sight. NURSE. O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day. Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever, I did yet behold! O day, O day, O day, O hateful day. Never was seen so black a day as this. O woeful day, O woeful day. PARIS. Beguil\u2019d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain. Most detestable death, by thee beguil\u2019d, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown. O love! O life! Not life, but love in death! CAPULET. Despis\u2019d, distressed, hated, martyr\u2019d, kill\u2019d. Uncomfortable time, why cam\u2019st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity? O child! O child! My soul, and not my child, Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead, And with my child my joys are buried. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion\u2019s cure lives not In these confusions. Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all, And all the better is it for the maid. Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. The most you sought was her promotion, For \u2019twas your heaven she should be advanc\u2019d, And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc\u2019d Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? O, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well. She\u2019s not well married that lives married long, But she\u2019s best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, And in her best array bear her to church; For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature\u2019s tears are reason\u2019s merriment. CAPULET. All things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral: Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast; Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change; Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him, And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave. The heavens do lower upon you for some ill; Move them no more by crossing their high will. [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._] FIRST MUSICIAN. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone. NURSE. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up, For well you know this is a pitiful case. FIRST MUSICIAN. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. [_Exit Nurse._] Enter Peter. PETER. Musicians, O, musicians, \u2018Heart\u2019s ease,\u2019 \u2018Heart\u2019s ease\u2019, O, and you will have me live, play \u2018Heart\u2019s ease.\u2019 FIRST MUSICIAN. Why \u2018Heart\u2019s ease\u2019? PETER. O musicians, because my heart itself plays \u2018My heart is full\u2019. O play me some merry dump to comfort me. FIRST MUSICIAN. Not a dump we, \u2019tis no time to play now. PETER. You will not then? FIRST MUSICIAN. No. PETER. I will then give it you soundly. FIRST MUSICIAN. What will you give us? PETER. No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel. FIRST MUSICIAN. Then will I give you the serving-creature. PETER. Then will I lay the serving-creature\u2019s dagger on your pate. I will carry no crotchets. I\u2019ll re you, I\u2019ll fa you. Do you note me? FIRST MUSICIAN. And you re us and fa us, you note us. SECOND MUSICIAN. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit. PETER. Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men. \u2018When griping griefs the heart doth wound, And doleful dumps the mind oppress, Then music with her silver sound\u2019\u2014 Why \u2018silver sound\u2019? Why \u2018music with her silver sound\u2019? What say you, Simon Catling? FIRST MUSICIAN. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. PETER. Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck? SECOND MUSICIAN. I say \u2018silver sound\u2019 because musicians sound for silver. PETER. Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost? THIRD MUSICIAN. Faith, I know not what to say. PETER. O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is \u2018music with her silver sound\u2019 because musicians have no gold for sounding. \u2018Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress.\u2019 [_Exit._] FIRST MUSICIAN. What a pestilent knave is this same! SECOND MUSICIAN. Hang him, Jack. Come, we\u2019ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner. [_Exeunt._]",

There\u2019s a fearful point! Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? Or, if I live, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place, As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where for this many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are pack\u2019d, Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort\u2014 Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking, what with loathsome smells, And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad. O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears, And madly play with my forefathers\u2019 joints? And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? And, in this rage, with some great kinsman\u2019s bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? O look, methinks I see my cousin\u2019s ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapier\u2019s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay! Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here\u2019s drink! I drink to thee.

It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierc\u2019d the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. ROMEO. It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night\u2019s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die. JULIET. Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet, thou need\u2019st not to be gone. ROMEO. Let me be ta\u2019en, let me be put to death, I am content, so thou wilt have it so. I\u2019ll say yon grey is not the morning\u2019s eye, \u2019Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia\u2019s brow. Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. I have more care to stay than will to go. Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is\u2019t, my soul? Let\u2019s talk. It is not day. JULIET. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away. It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. Some say the lark makes sweet division; This doth not so, for she divideth us. Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes. O, now I would they had chang\u2019d voices too, Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunt\u2019s-up to the day. O now be gone, more light and light it grows. ROMEO. More light and light, more dark and dark our woes. Enter Nurse. NURSE. Madam. JULIET. Nurse? NURSE. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. The day is broke, be wary, look about. [_Exit._] JULIET. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. ROMEO. Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I\u2019ll descend. [_Descends._] JULIET. Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are many days. O, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo. ROMEO. Farewell! I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. JULIET. O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again? ROMEO. I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come. JULIET. O God! I have an ill-divining soul! Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails, or thou look\u2019st pale. ROMEO. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu. [_Exit below._] JULIET. O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle, If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown\u2019d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune; For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back. LADY CAPULET. [_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up? JULIET. Who is\u2019t that calls? Is it my lady mother? Is she not down so late, or up so early? What unaccustom\u2019d cause procures her hither? Enter Lady Capulet. LADY CAPULET. Why, how now, Juliet? JULIET. Madam, I am not well. LADY CAPULET. Evermore weeping for your cousin\u2019s death? What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love, But much of grief shows still some want of wit. JULIET. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. LADY CAPULET. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for. JULIET. Feeling so the loss, I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. LADY CAPULET. Well, girl, thou weep\u2019st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughter\u2019d him. JULIET. What villain, madam? LADY CAPULET. That same villain Romeo. JULIET. Villain and he be many miles asunder. God pardon him. I do, with all my heart. And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. LADY CAPULET. That is because the traitor murderer lives. JULIET. Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands. Would none but I might venge my cousin\u2019s death. LADY CAPULET. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. Then weep no more. I\u2019ll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banish\u2019d runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustom\u2019d dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied. JULIET. Indeed I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold him\u2014dead\u2014 Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex\u2019d. Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors To hear him nam\u2019d, and cannot come to him, To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that hath slaughter\u2019d him. LADY CAPULET. Find thou the means, and I\u2019ll find such a man. But now I\u2019ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. JULIET. And joy comes well in such a needy time. What are they, I beseech your ladyship? LADY CAPULET. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, That thou expects not, nor I look\u2019d not for. JULIET. Madam, in happy time, what day is that? LADY CAPULET. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter\u2019s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. JULIET. Now by Saint Peter\u2019s Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride. I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. I pray you tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. These are news indeed. LADY CAPULET. Here comes your father, tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands. Enter Capulet and Nurse. CAPULET. When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; But for the sunset of my brother\u2019s son It rains downright. How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears? Evermore showering? In one little body Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind. For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs, Who raging with thy tears and they with them, Without a sudden calm will overset Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife? Have you deliver\u2019d to her our decree? LADY CAPULET. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave. CAPULET. Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife. How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? JULIET. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate; But thankful even for hate that is meant love. CAPULET. How now, how now, chopp\u2019d logic? What is this? Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not; And yet not proud. Mistress minion you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints \u2019gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter\u2019s Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage! You tallow-face! LADY CAPULET. Fie, fie! What, are you mad? JULIET. Good father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word. CAPULET. Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch! I tell thee what,\u2014get thee to church a Thursday, Or never after look me in the face. Speak not, reply not, do not answer me. My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child; But now I see this one is one too much, And that we have a curse in having her. Out on her, hilding. NURSE. God in heaven bless her. You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. CAPULET. And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue, Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go. NURSE. I speak no treason. CAPULET. O God ye good-en! NURSE. May not one speak? CAPULET. Peace, you mumbling fool! Utter your gravity o\u2019er a gossip\u2019s bowl, For here we need it not. LADY CAPULET. You are too hot. CAPULET. God\u2019s bread, it makes me mad! Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her match\u2019d, and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage, Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied, Stuff\u2019d, as they say, with honourable parts, Proportion\u2019d as one\u2019s thought would wish a man, And then to have a wretched puling fool, A whining mammet, in her fortune\u2019s tender, To answer, \u2018I\u2019ll not wed, I cannot love, I am too young, I pray you pardon me.\u2019 But, and you will not wed, I\u2019ll pardon you. Graze where you will, you shall not house with me. Look to\u2019t, think on\u2019t, I do not use to jest. Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise. And you be mine, I\u2019ll give you to my friend; And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For by my soul, I\u2019ll ne\u2019er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good. Trust to\u2019t, bethink you, I\u2019ll not be forsworn. [_Exit._] JULIET. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, That sees into the bottom of my grief? O sweet my mother, cast me not away, Delay this marriage for a month, a week, Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. LADY CAPULET. Talk not to me, for I\u2019ll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. [_Exit._] JULIET. O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven. How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me. Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself. What say\u2019st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, Nurse. NURSE. Faith, here it is. Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne\u2019er come back to challenge you. Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the County. O, he\u2019s a lovely gentleman. Romeo\u2019s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead, or \u2019twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him. JULIET. Speakest thou from thy heart? NURSE. And from my soul too, Or else beshrew them both. JULIET. Amen. NURSE. What? JULIET. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeas\u2019d my father, to Lawrence\u2019 cell, To make confession and to be absolv\u2019d. NURSE. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. [_Exit._] JULIET. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais\u2019d him with above compare So many thousand times? Go, counsellor. Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. I\u2019ll to the Friar to know his remedy. If all else fail, myself have power to die. [_Exit._]",

Look you, she lov\u2019d her kinsman Tybalt dearly, And so did I. Well, we were born to die. \u2019Tis very late; she\u2019ll not come down tonight. I promise you, but for your company, I would have been abed an hour ago. PARIS. These times of woe afford no tune to woo. Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter. LADY CAPULET. I will, and know her mind early tomorrow; Tonight she\u2019s mew\u2019d up to her heaviness. CAPULET. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child\u2019s love. I think she will be rul\u2019d In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not. Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed, Acquaint her here of my son Paris\u2019 love, And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next, But, soft, what day is this? PARIS. Monday, my lord. CAPULET. Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon, A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her, She shall be married to this noble earl. Will you be ready? Do you like this haste? We\u2019ll keep no great ado,\u2014a friend or two, For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman, if we revel much. Therefore we\u2019ll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? PARIS. My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow. CAPULET. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then. Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day. Farewell, my lord.\u2014Light to my chamber, ho! Afore me, it is so very very late that we May call it early by and by. Good night. [_Exeunt._]",
