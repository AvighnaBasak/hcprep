Here's a summary of the text in modern English:

The story begins with the narrator, Ishmael, who signs up to work on the whaleship Pequod. The ship is captained by Ahab, a vengeful and obsessed man who is determined to hunt down and kill the white whale Moby-Dick, which had destroyed his ship and leg in a previous encounter.

As the Pequod sets sail, Ishmael becomes fast friends with Queequeg, a harpooneer from a distant island. The two men form a close bond, and Queequeg becomes like a brother to Ishmael.

However, Ahab's obsession with Moby-Dick begins to take over the ship. He convinces the crew to help him hunt down the whale, despite their reservations. Meanwhile, Ishmael and Queequeg continue to explore the ship and learn about its history and traditions.

The Pequod eventually finds Moby-Dick, and a fierce battle ensues. In the chaos, Ahab's harpoon gets tangled in the rope that connects the boat to the whale, and he is pulled overboard, leaving the crew behind.

Ishmael survives the wreck by clinging to a coffin lifebuoy, which keeps him afloat as the ship sinks. He is eventually picked up by the Rachel, another ship that is searching for its missing crew members.

The story concludes with Ishmael reflecting on the tragedy of the Pequod and the loss of his friends Queequeg and Ahab. The novel ends with Ishmael's epiphany that he is the only one left to tell the tale, which becomes a metaphor for the human experience of living through trauma and finding ways to move forward.

Throughout the story, Melville explores themes of obsession, revenge, and redemption, as well as the complexities of human nature. The novel is known for its poetic prose, vivid descriptions of life at sea, and philosophical musings on the human condition.
