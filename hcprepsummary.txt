Here is a summary of the text in modern English, about 800 words:

As the sun sets on the ocean, the crew of the Pequod is exhausted and battered from their relentless pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick. Captain Ahab, driven by his obsessive hatred for the whale, has been pushing his men to their limits, determined to finally confront and destroy the beast that took his leg.

The ship's boat, with Ahab at the helm, approaches the whale, which is swimming rapidly through the sea. As they close in, the whale suddenly changes direction, causing the boat to tip and sending some of the oarsmen tumbling into the water. The others manage to grab hold of the gunwale and pull themselves back on board.

Meanwhile, the ship itself has been left behind, with only a few inches of its mast still visible above the waves. On this exposed spar, the flag still flies, streaming out like a banner as the Pequod sinks beneath the surface.

As the boat recovers from the chaos, Ahab spots his chance and grabs hold of the harpoon, ready to strike the final blow. The whale, sensing its attacker, turns to face him, but Ahab is undeterred. With a fierce cry, he launches the harpoon at the whale, which then rolls over onto its side, pinning the boat beneath it.

In the chaos that follows, the crew members scramble to free themselves from the wreckage of the boat and the sea. As they struggle, some are swept away by the powerful currents, while others cling to life as best they can.

As the sun dips below the horizon, the Pequod disappears into the depths of the ocean, taking its crew with it. The last remnants of the ship's hull finally succumb to the pressure, allowing the water to rush in and claim its own.
